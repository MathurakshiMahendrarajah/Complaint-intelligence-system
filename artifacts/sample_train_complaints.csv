"We have received several calls from a man named  XXXX   XXXX  looking for my husband. He refuses to provide any more details other than his name and  XXXX  number, saying this ous a personal matter. Due to how rude he has been coupled with the lack of information from him, I asked him to correspond via mail, and to stop calling. The calls stopped, but never received anything in the mail. Several weeks pass, and  XXXX   XXXX  called our house again this morning. I explained my husband was unavailable, and asked if I could help him. He asked me to just have my husband call him, and provided his name and  XXXX  number. When i asked what company he was with, he refused to tell me, only saying it 's a personal matter. I told him, "" no, you need to tell me what company you represent or I wo n't have my husband call back ''. He said, "" real immature. How about you grow up? '' I said, "" excuse me?!

I then asked to speak with his boss because I was upset at the insulting bullying tactics  XXXX   XXXX  was utilizing. The receptionist, who did not give her name, chided me while saying, "" look at how you 're talking! You are immature and need to grow up!

"A purchase was made online for product "" A '', but the item was no delivered, instead a product item "" B '' was sent instead, with a modified invoice without my permission or consultation. 

Vendor ignored email requests for a return shipping label, after claiming to accept returns and refunds. 

Dispute was made to citibank via secured chat, full details including product model numbers were given. But days later, citibank reversed the temporary credit after vendor claimed they delivered the product. There was no follow-up from citibank prior to this claim. I further certified that I did not received the product as ordered, but instead was met with a citibank letter detailing that I needed to obtain a written permission from vendor in order to obtain a credit refund. Despite me stating I have evidences in the 2 chat, 1 email and 2 phone calls made to citibank. They have not made any attempts to obtain them or verify them from me. 

A phone call was made to the dispute department ( XXXX answered ), here I was appalled to discover that there was no means to contact the case person in charge, that the call was no recorded, and no information from that call will even reach the dispute department., and that the department had registered my dispute wrongly as non-delivered product and had decided to listen to a one-sided story from the vendor instead of verifying or consulting me in person. 

A letter was sent via the only method to possibly ( because I do not think they read it honestly ) reach the department ( as notified by the phone rep - XXXX ). Here in this letter, I detailed all email correspondences, XXXX dispute process, chatlog, photos of product B which was delivered in stead of A, including packaging and a invoice showing what was delivered versus what I ordered. 

The case was later closed by citibank with this exact remark : "" Since there is no detailed description of the merchandise or services excepted to receive, we are unable to assist you in obtaining funds from the merchant '' Citibank has presented that their dispute department is incapable of performing due dilligences in dispute cases, unable to communicate even within their own departments, and extremely unwilling to allow customer to call them out on their fails.",Credit / Prepaid card

I simply received a heavily worded letter from them denying me an investigation, claiming that my verification provided was not sufficient. I am afraid that they are stalling me and deliberately ignoring my request for an investigation into an expunged civil claim. 
I had provived vey sufficient and actually excessive amount of verification and they claim that I am not who I am and therefore they will not process anything from until i forfeit more proof or documentation.

They are violating me and pushing me around by requested personal information and documentation that is overly suspspcious and not safe to send via mail. I have had cases of IDENTIFTY Theft and ban fraud committed against me and I am very weary of sending anything above and beyond expected. 
I think that my documentation was extremely sufficient and in actuality this company is avoiding me, hurting me, and accusing me of not being me. They are using such tactics a lot against consumers an that is not fair. Who else would I be? How dare they deny me after EVERYTHING I supplied on my behalf.

"On Sunday XXXX XXXX 2017 I walked into a TD Bank in XXXX N.J. to deposit a check that I was suspicious about its authenticity.The funds were sent to me by someone posing to buy something from me online and I was sent the movers money as well to pass on. I informed the teller that I was suspicious about the check and wanted to know when I can be sure the check was authentic before using the funds. The teller informed me that the check will take 2 days to clear and by Tuesday I should check to see if its still pending. Once the check is n't pending and the funds have been added to the account I can be sure the check was legit and cleared. I deposited part of the check and cashed the remainder and waited till Tuesday to use the funds.On Tuesday morning I checked and the check was no longer pending and the funds were safely in my account. I took the funds and sent them to the supposed mover. On Wednesday, I see that the amount for the check had been taken out of my account. Upon contacting the bank I was informed that the check had insufficient funds and the bank took out money from my account in the amount of the check.Basically I had been scammed.
I was shocked as I had suspected this may have been the case and deliberately asked the bank how to proceed.I followed the exact instructions given to me by the bank. The bank refuses to take any responsibility and insists that its my issue. How can I protect my own money when the bank helps the scammers and could care less about their own costumers? How was I to know not to trust the bank teller? How come there 's no laws protecting consumers from the banks mistakes?
I went back to the bank and videoed myself asking the bank teller the question again.I asked the question to 3 different tellers, receiving the identical answer. They assured me I have nothing to worry about once the check clears and funds have been permanently added to the account. I tried to enclose the video below, however the size was too big to upload. I 'm going to attempt to post it online wherever possible, in an attempt for the truth to get out, if there 's still someone left with some sort of honest conscious, someone who realizes there 's more to life than getting away with someone else 's money.
Its frightening to see how little the bank cares about you, the very institution who you trust your money with and is supposed to be helping you.Its 2017, and our country has laws protecting animals, plants, and ancient buildings, but cant get they 're act together to help people being bullied and taken advantage of by financial institutions.

"I opened a student checking account at Cathay Bank. They switched my account to a Personal Checking account with a daily minimum balance of {$1000.00} WITHOUT informing me in writing. The only indication that my bank account type has changed is the {$10.00} maintenance fee on my XXXX monthly statement. While their current website says the student checking account is only valid for XXXX years, it does not say, and I was never informed, that my student checking account would be AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT NOTICE changed into a Personal Checking account with a XXXX monthly maintenance fee. Had they informed me, IN WRITING, I would have closed my account and created a new student checking account, as I am still a student. They later told my power of attorney XXXX PoA XXXX that in order to renew a student account, I had to fly back personally, XXXX, to do so, even though my student status is unchanged. 

When my PoA went to the bank, on XXXX, a teller told her only that the {$10.00} maintenance fee was because my new account type had a minimum balance that we did not meet. To rectify this, my representative wrote a check for {$500.00} to Cathay Bank to satisfy it, since she was only told verbally that there was one. No bank personnel advised my PoA that this was a DAILY minimum balance rather than a monthly minimum, and they failed to give us the relevant Bank Account Disclosures for the new Personal Checking account. 

When my PoA returned to close the account on XXXX with an account representative, she was told that we were charged another {$10.00} in XXXX because we were under the {$1000.00} for a few days, which again, nobody informed us was a DAILY minimum. Had they given me the account disclosure materials, in writing, we would have known that this was a DAILY and not a MONTHLY minimum balance before they charged another {$10.00} in maintenance fees. Consequently, because they deducted the second {$10.00} in fees for XXXX, they informed us that we would see another {$10.00} deducted in XXXX because the new {$10.00} they deducted for XXXX officially put my account below the {$1000.00} daily minimum balance again. 

Had they advised us IN WRITING before changing my account type and then given us the Bank Account Disclosures, I would not have been deducted {$30.00} in maintenance fees due to their negligence. One of the agents at the bank, after some time arguing with my PoA, agreed to consider making an internal note waiving one of the {$10.00} fees but "" but we will be charged in XXXX as well.

Customer service explained to me that payments are applied to the statement balance first before other transactions.

I logged into my loan servicing site, Navient, to make my normal payments for the month of XXXX and discovered that all of my loans both private and federal had been placed into deferment. I never received any communication or request for approval for this to happen. I called Navient to try and resolve the issue, requesting that all of my loans be taken out of deferment and returned to the normal payment schedule I was previously on. My concern was, since the loans were placed into deferment, interest would begin to accrue and further more be capitalized into my principal. I made it clear in my initial call that I wanted the loans out of deferment, and to return to my normal payment schedule specifically to avoid any interest being capitalized. I was informed that my loans were removed from deferment and that I would be able to make my normal monthly payment for XXXX. I then proceeded to make my normal payments as I had done previously. 

Then in XXXX, when I logged back into my account to make my payment for that month, not only did I notice that I had not been returned to my normal payment schedule, Navient had also capitalized approximately {$100.00} worth of interest, despite me having made my normal payment for XXXX. I called again to have this straightened out explaining that I was to be returned to my normal pay schedule for XXXX and that the payment I made should be applied normally to avoid any interest capitalizing.

The site would not allow me to back out or change my information. I had to turn off my phone to get out of the site. I called my credit card company to make sure there were no charges for this product. They said there were no charges on my account. The web site had no phone numbers or contact information. I forgot about the matter and a week later I received 6 bottles of the product and my credit card was charged {$190.00}. On the statement I received from the Company there was a phone number and a name of the company. I immediately called the phone number to explained what happened and that I did not order the product and wanted to return them. The rep. told me there would be a charge of {$6.00} per bottle and shipping charges. I said that is fraud. I hung up and called my credit card company and explained what happened and wanted to report it as fraud.

I called to return the product. The Company said that they closed my account and I could not return the items, and my account was closed as soon as they were contacted from the credit card company back in  XXXX  regarding fraud. The credit card company does not believe that I did not order the product because all my information was given to them regarding purchasing from the Company.

"We applied for shortsale assistance XX/XX/XXXX, as it was offered to us to help us avoid foreclosure.

We sent them the comps they wanted 'Non Dis-stressed, Foreclosures or Shortsales ' to be used as comps? Does this make any sense. Why is n't the bank using comparables to my house, in the current dis stressed condition it is in, to appraise the property? Because it does n't benefit them! I feel the bank is purposely delaying this shortsale and not coming to the true market value of this property because they would rather see it go into foreclosure. Which during this process they would stop foreclosure actions, the bank just filed the les pendens law suit about 1 month ago, knowing we have had a contract in place for shortsale processing. I am not sure if this is a form of discrimination or some scam. For example, on the 'latest ' contract in for shortsale approval, XXXX different BPO/Appraisal people came out for the bank, within days of each other, XXXX is reported to just take pictures, no value dispute the other is told to do full BPO. When they go back to submit the work, the lenders request is cancelled. Why is the bank stalling to finalize this shortsale.

I called and they told me I was sent a notice that this change would happen.

FedLoan claimed they were unable to do that because they had sent me a notice. I explained that I never got the notice, but it did not make any difference to them. I am now overdrawn and have no guarantee I will get that money back. I live on a tight income, and this is devastating. 

In the past they were totally uncooperative when I asked for them to change my payment due date.

Now, my son would have to fly to Arizona just to sign the card. It doesnt make sense to me and the Chase bank representative could not give me a good reason for it.

"It is imperative that consumer ( XXXX XXXX ) file a formal complaint with the CFPB in responding to dunning letters sent by Credit Management of XXXX XXXX, Nebraska. Credit Management is known for filing judgments against consumers without waiting the 30-day timeline allotted under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Credit Management of XXXX XXXX, Nebraska does not accept CERTIFIED MAIL with Return Receipts when sent to them as a verification of "" dunning '' letters. Credit Management has a business practice of sending numerous dunning letters to the same consumer, with the same date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) alleging consumer owes several accounts ( Acct No. : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) with several reference numbers and several different amounts on one single account. This is unnecessary, redundant, and deceptive. This business practice equates unjust enrichment and fraud. In this consumers case the entity Credit Management claims to be collecting on behalf of the XXXX   XXXX XXXX who received a Medicare and XXXX coinsurance payment as well as a co-payment from consumer. Accepting these payments renders consumers account with the XXXX  XXXX XXXX paid-in-full. Consumer has a co-payment receipt to prove it! ( XXXX XXXX  Receipt # : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX for {$35.00} dollars ). Anything over this payment is considered balance billing and illegal. ( See Sections of the Social Security Act [ the Act ]. 1902 ( n ) ( 3 ) ( B ) 4714.

Attached to this complaint is a copy of a letter sent to the XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX making it known that consumer does not owe anything. It is self explanatory and will satisfy any monetary claims regarding Credit Management 's involvement. Credit Management is known to pursue frivolous lawsuits and obtain unwarranted judgments without the knowledge of the debtor and with no basis at law. Credit Managements frivolous lawsuits are intended to get information, force payment through fear of legal entanglement or gain unfair or illegal advantage. Credit Management uses the legal process for illegal, malicious or perverted means. It is important that consumer use this venue to convey a strong message that consumer has rights and protection under state and federal law and that there will be serious ramifications if those rights and protections are violated. 

Consumers sole income is Social Security income which is federally protected income under the Social Security Administration Act ( SSA ) ; Sec. 207. [ 42 U.S.C. 407 ] ( a ). Consumer has a copy of consumers Social Security Award letter as proof positive documentation. Consumer has no attachable property of value. Please be advised : Under compilation of the Social Security Laws Section 207 [ 42 U.S.C. 407 ] ( a ) which states : the right of any person to any future payment under this title shall NOT be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law., whether consumer gives permission or not they do not have the authority to authorize garnishment of a federally protected account. Under Nebraska Revised Statute Section 25-1563.01. ; the same Supreme Court ruling applies in this matter as well. 

Consumers protected income presents a genuine issue of material fact that if a summary judgment is granted ( after receipt of this formal notification ) it shall be obtained through a deceptive, frivolous, abusive and harassing process that can garner monetary retribution for consumer. Consumer refuses to be a victim of unjust enrichment and extortive tactics. Consumer has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to a third party debt collector because there is no exchange of any benefit or detriment with ANY future collection agencies, junk debt buyers ( JDB ) or collection law firms. There will be no enforceable agreement. No payment history, nor products, or services has been rendered to such entities because these elements do not exist ; there is a 'failure of consideration ' and no valid agreement, contract or fiduciary obligation under federal law that requires payment to such parties. If Credit Management continues to harass, abuse or pursue consumer ( XXXX XXXX ) the Nebraska Attorney Generals Consumer Protection Division ( CPD ) ; and the Federal Trades Commission ( FTC ) will be notified as a prelude to a formal lawsuit against Credit Management, as genuine issues of material fact exist.",Debt collection

She then said that it could 've been due to wrong account number/being a number off etc. I then asked why was n't I informed about my loan being 64 days past due, especially due to the fact that I had just spoke with a CSR last month and I was n't informed about it being late.

He then tried to verify my contact info, which was all wrong ( do n't quite know where they got this information from. ) he then stated that 's why I have n't been receiving notifications, which I still find inexcusable due to the fact that BOA can send me a notification via email on multiple occasions asking me to complete a survey about my call but no notification to inform me that the loan that they are financing is delinquent ( again backwards ) and as of today ( XXXX ) I still ca n't pay my auto loan due to notes that were placed in the system and all it does is connect me to a CSR.",Vehicle loan or lease

"*PLEASE HELP, WRONGFUL FORECLOSURE SALE SCHEDULED IN ONLY 7 DAYS* Dear CFPB representatives, I 'm writing this letter to request your assistance in stopping my wrongful foreclosure sale that is scheduled for next week on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( 7 days away ). 

Caliber Home Loans is calculating my financial input values incorrectly for the sole purpose of denying me for mortgage assistance and I have proof to back up my statement. I tried to resolve the issue internally with XXXX but they continue to violate the law and my rights by wrongfully denying me for mortgage assistance. 

I have outlined in this request for assistance all of the egregious and abhorrent issues with regard to the wrongful and prejudiced Request for Mortgage Assistance denial dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

*WRONGFUL AND PREJUDICED RMA DENIAL DETAILS* ( Reason for Denial ) We are unable to offer you a Loan Modification because your loan to value ratio ( LTV ) must be over XXXX % to be eligible ( Issue w/ Denial # XXXX ) Completely Bogus! Caliber provided a loan payoff amount ( see attached ) for {$580000.00} and set property value at {$570000.00} per the attached BPO provided by. The denial states that my LTV is less than XXXX %, which disqualifies me for assistance but the calculation is INCORRECT! My LTV is over XXXX % ( see attached ) based on the data provided by Caliber alone. 

( Issue w/ Denial # 2 ) Caliber is conveying that they are calculating the LTV using only the unpaid principal balance of {$390000.00} from the payoff statement listing the payoff amount of {$580000.00} described as "" PAYMENT DUE TO RELEASE LIEN '' by Caliber. The actions of Caliber are not only unfair and abusive but that are also in direct violation of both state and federal law, making their actions also illegal. The LTV calculation is defined as follows by XXXX : "" The LTV ratio is calculated as the amount of the mortgage lien divided by the appraised value of the property, expressed as a percentage. For example, a borrower taking on a {$92000.00} mortgage to purchase a home appraised at {$100000.00} would have an LTV ratio of XXXX % ( XXXX/XXXX ). '' Based on the definition and example above, Caliber would use the lien release amount of {$580000.00} ( see payoff statement ) as the L value in the LTV ratio with an accompany property value of {$570000.00} as the V value, which would make the LTV over XXXX % ( XXXX % ) and put me in the "" underwater '' category, thereby qualifying me for mortgage assistance. Caliber 's denial and perpetuation of foreclosure are wrongful and illegal! 

( Issue w/ Denial # 3 ) Caliber calculated my LTV using only the unpaid principal balance of {$390000.00} and the property value of {$570000.00} to deny me for mortgage assistance. If Caliber will agree to take {$390000.00} to payoff the loan and if my property value is {$570000.00}, I already have multiple offers to refinance my loan with almost XXXX % equity per Caliber 's calculations and denial. 

Therefore, please halt the foreclosure proceedings immediately to give me an opportunity to refinance my home over the next 30 days away from Caliber for the amount of {$390000.00} ( the unpaid principal balance ) ( Issue w/ Denial # 4 ) I should still be eligible for MHA HAMP Tier 2 based on the false inputs that were used to calculate the new payment amount presented in offer from XXXX XXXX. I never defaulted on MHA HAMP Tier 2 TPP payments nor did I default on a MHA HAMP Tier 2 loan modification, which means that I remain eligible for MHA HAMP Tier 2 presently. Caliber never completed an escrow analysis for this mortgage loan to determine if there was a shortage and the exact shortage, which means that the escrow shortage payment of {$500.00} per month CAN NOT be validated. I should have the opportunity to apply for MHA HAMP mortgage assistance at this time based on the unethical and fraudulent MHA HAMP Tier 2 loan modification offered in the past by Caliber.",Mortgage

I checked my online account today and my statement for XX/XX/XXXX shows a late fee of {$25.00} and past due of {$32.00}, as well as credits for {$25.00} and {$32.00} ( meaning that the credits were applied to principal instead of reversing the charges ). Additionally, my minimum payment amount, which contractually should be 1 % of the outstanding balance was now {$89.00} instead of the {$32.00} is should be. This was because B of A was adding the late fee and "" past due amount '' to the minimum amount due ( {$32.00} + {$25.00} + {$32.00} = {$89.00} ). I have contacted Bank of America 's customer service multiply times and have been told that there is nothing that they can do. I feel that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for a company to tell a customer that they have a payment due and after the customer makes the payment, apply it to the previous statement cycle and increase the next minimum payment due. While the increase from {$32.00} to {$89.00} has little affect on my ability to make my payment, I 'm concerned that this practice could but some borrowers into the position of not being able to make the increased payment. If this is happening because of a timing issue between B of A 's online system and accounting system, it seems to me that it is something that B of A should correct, not an issue that should be passed on to their consumers.",Credit / Prepaid card

"Hello, On XX/XX/2018, I received a phone call while outside the company on a vacation with my family. The caller stated that he was calling from American Express and stated that we were referred to him by an individual to offer us business credit card for our business use.

This was made very clear then I am asked for my social security number.

I informed him that I don't want my credit to be used neither do I want to be personally linked to the credit decision. I informed him that I will not continue with process if my credit will be checked. He assured me that he can use only the business credit and then proceeded to ask for the business federal tax ID.

"I, XXXX XXXX, ( the "" Borrower '' ) am the innocent victim of foreclosure fraud perpetrated by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. and abetted by FAY SERVICING LLC. ( the "" SERVICER '' ). Current Servicer of record is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , IL XXXX, ATTN : XXXX XXXX XXXX , VP of Servicing, tel. ( XXXX ). Borrower 's Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) Account No. is XXXX. 

According to the terms of Borrower 's HELOC contract with Servicer ( successor to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ) dated and commenced on XX/XX/XXXX, funds to pay for the monthly Periodic Finance Charge ( interest and interest only ) as stipulated by the Automatic Payment Authorization provision in the HELOC contract are to be debited monthly.

This above-referenced debiting from Borrower 's checking account occurred successfully and faultlessly from the HELOC loan 's inception until XX/XX/XXXX, a period of almost eight ( 8 ) years, when the Servicer and its successors put Borrower 's HELOC loan into "" default '' status claiming there were insufficient funds in his checking account to pay for that month 's Periodic Finance Charge. On the contrary, Borrower has endorsed XXXX  XXXX, XXXX. deposit slip proof indicating the funds in cash were in Borrower 's checking account per the terms of the HELOC contract each and every month through the present date. Servicer and its successors commenced a fraudulent foreclosure action upon the Borrower without ever providing a truthful and valid reason as to the cause as to why and how there could be insufficient funds in Borrower 's checking account.

The Servicer and its successors never truthfully nor timely nor completely responded to Borrower 's multiple verbal as well as written requests to answer the reason for the insufficient funds. After several years, the Borrower ascertained that the Servicer and its successors illegally and fraudulently debited the Borrower 's checking account to pay a Lender-Placed Flood Policy premium in XX/XX/XXXX. The servicer and its successors never complained before this XX/XX/XXXX date, an approximate eight ( 8 ) year period, that the Borrower was ever not compliant with his flood policy coverage per the terms of the HELOC contract. Instead, the servicer and its successors illicitly debited the Borrower 's checking account.The Borrower demands that the Servicer provide himself and the CFPB, under penalty of perjury, the following in writing, signed and notarized by a FAY SERVICING LLC. officer : a ) Set forth full detailed proof that the Servicer owns the 'DEBT ' or 'NOTE ' (  HELOC Loan No. XXXX ) which it claims the Borrower owes to the Servicer. If so, request is made for the Servicer to produce evidence of such debt in the form of a Promissory Note or other agreement. b ) If the Servicer does not produce such evidence, the Servicer must set forth full detailed proof as to why the Servicer can not produce the above-referenced NOTE.

2 ) The Servicer must set forth full detailed proof of all itemized foreclosure fees, late fees, lender fees, and legal fees accruing to the Borrower 's Fleet Line Agreement HELOC account and set forth full detailed proof that all of these itemized monies were in fact paid by the Servicer and to whom.

3 ) Set forth full detailed proof that the Borrower was offered by the Servicer and its successors a Repayment Plan to cure the so-called default in the Borrower 's Fleet Line Agreement HELOC account. If so, set forth full detailed copies thereof and also, when and by whom from the Servicer and its successors.

4 ) Set forth full detailed proof that the Servicer and its successors has the authority to automatically debit the Borrower 's checking account for any Lender-Placed Flood Policy premiums. Similarly, set forth full detailed proof as to which provision in the Automatic Payment Authorization gives the Servicer and its successors authority to do this without the written approval of the Borrower.

5 ) Set forth full detailed proof that the Servicer acknowledges that the sole entire reason for the Borrower 's default is the non-payment of the above-referenced Lender-Placed Flood Policy premium resulting in the Servicer and its successors causing insufficient funds in Borrower 's checking account.

6 ) Set forth full detailed proof of the Borrower 's consumer authorization to the servicer and its successors, excepting the monthly Periodic Finance Charges, as payment for all other miscellaneous charges as governed by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978 to be debited in full by the Borrower 's Automatic Payment Authorization feature in the Borrower 's HELOC contract with the Servicer and its successors.

7 ) a ) Set forth full detailed proof that the individual Lender-Placed Flood Policy premiums were sent yearly to the Borrower for payment from XX/XX/XXXX through the present date. 
b ) Set forth full detailed proof that the Borrower was sent a copy of the billing notice that the Lender-Placed Flood policy premium payment was due the Servicer and its successors and for what amount for each year from XX/XX/XXXX through the present date. 

8 ) Set forth full detailed proof as to what specific charges accumulate in the Fleet Line agreement HELOC closing costs at end of term when a "" Net-to-Close '' figure is provided by the Servicer to the Borrower. 

9 ) Set forth full detailed proof of the Servicer and its successors producing the Securitization of the Borrower 's Fleet Line Agreement 'NOTE ' in its entirety tracing any change in transition from the date of the original closing, XX/XX/XXXX, through the present date.

"I applied and was approved for a Bank of America XXXX credit card in XXXX XXXX. The terms and conditions I received from BOA with my credit card specified that I had a 0 % introductory APR on purchases made prior to XXXX XXXX. All purchases made after XXXX XXXX would be subject to the standard APR. I searched the remainder of the T & C 's document to be certain the balances remaining would not be subject to the increased APR, and nothing on the terms and conditions indicated that purchases made during the introductory period needed to be paid in full prior to the end of the introductory period. I was very pleased and adjusted my spending accordingly. 

I received XXXX notification advising that my terms and conditions had been adjusted ( in XXXX XXXX ), but that notification did not reference the introductory APR. Each of my bills notified me that the introductory period would expire in XXXX XXXX, but that was no surprise to me. I knew purchases made after the introductory period would be subject to an increased APR. I used my entire limit prior to the expiration of the introductory period, but was quite surprised when I noticed a {$90.00} interest charge in XXXX of XXXX. 

I immediately called Bank of America and was told by the representative that BOA only sent me the short form of their terms and conditions, but the long form ( viewable by BOA employees only ) included language that specified balances carried forward would be subject to an increased APR. Naturally, I was quite frustrated to learn that BOA intentionally misled me by giving me an abbreviated contract that left out critical details like this. He agreed and credited the {$90.00} with the promise that future interest charges would be investigated and adjusted to honor the terms and conditions. 

Now it is XXXX of XXXX, and the majority of the balance remaining on my card is erroneously charged interest. Bank of America never responded to the request from XXXX XXXX, and they refuse to credit my account the interest charged on purchases made from XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX. 

The terms and conditions available on their website now ( presumably those that new card holders receive ) read much differently than those provided to me as they indicate the inroductory APR only applies to the first XXXX billing statements. I wish I received those terms. Had that been what was represented to me when I secured the card, I would have managed my spending accordingly.",Credit / Prepaid card

"My Grandmother was diagnosed a number of years ago with XXXX. XXXX. I was asked by both of my Grandparents to handle their finances. We went to the bank ( s ) and added my name to their checking account and their mail was re-routed to my house. That was over 6 years ago. My Grandfather passed two years ago but shortly before he did, his daughter and son in law moved in. It was a "" XXXX '' to hear my Aunt and Uncle tell it but I found it interesting that their house had been foreclosed on. Shortly after they moved in I started noticing checks being cashed after their social security check was deposited. My Grandparents ritually only cashed a check for {$100.00} a month for years. Several months ago, after my Grandfather 's passing, we consolidated all of my Grandmother money into one bank, BBT. We deposited over {$80000.00} into an investment account with my name and my grandmother 's name. My grandmother has a POA which names my father and my Aunt as co-power of attorneys. I asked BB & T if we could use the POA because that way both heirs would be responsible for the funds. The BB & T representative told me that Power of Attorneys have to be approved and it takes a long time and it may not even be approved. The name of the BB & T representative was XXXX XXXX. We proceed to conduct business without the power of attorney. We changed my Grandfather 's IRA account into my Grandmother name and opened an investment account with the {$80000.00} with my name and my Grandmother 's name. That gave us a total of XXXX accounts with BBT. The first account was the checking account that I was added to years ago, an IRA account with approx. {$60000.00} and we opened an investment account with my name and my grandmothers with an opening balance of {>= $1,000,000}. 
At this visit, I explained that my relatives ( my Aunt and Uncle ) had been cashing checks on ( sometimes several days in a row ) on the checking account. My Aunt and Uncle would have my Grandmother sign checks and complete for cash. This was not reported. If you look at the account history you can see all of the cash checks and on occasion my Grandmother would sign a check and leave the payee and the amount incomplete. Someone else would complete the check to "" Cash '' and complete the amount. Sometimes checks would clear this account and the payee or dollar amount would be completed but they cleared the bank. The amount of cashed checks recently started to increase so I was unable to pay her bills with her incoming social security checks. Over the last few months her water was turned off because their was not enough money to pay the bill because of amount of cashed checks. My Aunt and Uncle also took my Grandmother to buy themselves a new car and my Grandmother was the borrower on the loan. Since my Grandfather passed it has been increasing difficult to pay her bills because she no longer has the benefit of his social security income. 

That brings me to today. In order to be proactive and keeping track of the account activity, I signed up for ever alert on both the checking account and the investment account. I received an alert that the investment account had a XXXX balance and that a {$1000.00} has been transferred from the checking account with less than {$300.00} left in the account. I called BBT and my Aunt took my Grandmother to the bank and opened a new account so they could have control over the money. If only BB & T had not discouraged me from opening the accounts with a POA then I would not be in this situation. They have taken away my ability to make sure that my Grandmother is financial secure. I am writing this because I made my Grandfather a promise. I promised him that I would watch every penny and make sure she was OK. I no longer can honor that promise.",Bank / Checking / Savings

Furthermore, they convinced me to sign up for paperless billing but do not tell students that in the event there is a problem with the account they will not call or write you. The email I signed up with years ago was hacked. I no longer had access to the email which means I did not have access to their noticing. This is unfair. It allows them to keep consumers uninformed and make statements like "" the fine print in your contract says ... or we don't have to contact you because you're in paperless billing.

I have been complaining to Equifax and the CFPB about this matter for almost a year, but nothing has been done.

Upon information and belief, no one from Equifax has taken accountability for my credit disputes, therefore no one from Equifax can testify in court against me.

Is it going to take millions of Americans to start submitting certified/notarized/sworn Affidavits of dispute, that would be filed with massive Federal Class Action complaints, to get Equifax to adhere to the law? Clearly, Equifax does not complete reasonable dispute investigations for consumers. From my personal experience, Equifax conducts investigations based on hearsay, which should cost them billions in Fair Credit Reporting Act violation fines and punitive damages.

In your letter, you state that the included contract substantiates proof of debt with XXXX XXXX. 
Unfortunately, your organization does not have the complete details regarding this matter. In my previous letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I stated why there is no contractual agreement between me and XXXX XXXX. 
I have been in dispute with XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX, the date of the original install of solar on my home ( See Exhibit # XXXX, Initial Permits in XX/XX/XXXX ). Because of insufficient production, my system was altered ( See Exhibit # XXXX, New Permits on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). With the introduction of the new system, I asked for a new contract to reflect the new system as well as provide me with new estimates of production. The old or initial contract was out of date because it did not reflect the system on my home and it did not provide me with estimates of production based upon the new system. 
XXXX refused to provide a new contract for the work that had been completed on my home. After exchanging with them over a period of time, they sent me a "" Settlement & Release Agreement '' on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( See Exhibit # XXXX ). I was refused to sign the agreement and asked them to remove the system from my home ( See Exhibit # XXXX ). I have multiple emails ( See Exhibit # XXXX ) between myself and XXXX XXXX ( XXXX representative ) which demonstrate we were in dispute regarding the solar system. As I previously stated, I finally asked XXXX XXXX and XXXX to remove the system from my home because I was not satisfied. XXXX XXXX has not responded to my request, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Once more, I dispute this alleged debt and I am hereby asking you to cease and desist requesting payment from me. I deny that the alleged debt is owed and my agreement for the solar system was rescinded based on several grounds, including : 1. The solar company refused to provide me with a contract for the solar system currently on my home. 
2. The system provided by the solar company has materially failed. 
3. Since the solar company was unable to resolve issues 1 and 2, I asked them to come and remove the system from my home and they did not respond. 
Once again, I would like to reinforce that no complete and enforceable written contract was ever entered into between me and the solar company. 
If Virtuoso Sourcing group continues its collection efforts, I will be forced to pursue this matter legally.

"I recently opened up a dispute with Equifax regarding the lone collection on my credit report with XXXX. My reason for the dispute is many, ( 1 ) XXXX has not validated this debt. I sent a letter to them that was delivered via certified mail ( see attachment ) on XX/XX/XXXX. ( 2 ) In the letter I requested that XXXX ( a ) provide proof of fees including any collection costs and medical charges ( b ) provide a copy of my signature with the provider of service to release my medical information to them ( c ) Cease any credit bureau reporting until the debt has been validated ( 3 ) XXXX has not responded to my letter ( 4 ) I sent XXXX a notice of failure to validate debt and per FDCRA the item must be removed from my account. The letter was sent XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX is still unresponsive. ( 5 ) I contacted the Office of Financial Regulation in the State of FL which requires ALL collection agencies be licensed and bonded in this State before attempting any collection activity including reporting derogatory information to the credit bureaus. They opened a case against XXXX and advised me to contact Equifax and advise that XXXX is in violation of Fl Statue 559.553 which is supported by 559.55 ( 11 ). The case number is XXXX. 
I sent the information to Equifax disputing this debt and asking that it be removed from my credit profile. I advised them that I do not owe this debt as my rehab bill was paid by my car insurance and if there was a balance, I had XXXX since XXXX and that the date of the car accident was XX/XX/XXXX. I also advised them that XXXX is not the legal owner of this debt, if it was owed, which it is not because they can not legally pursue any collection activity in the State of FL in which I reside and have resided my entire life. In addition, I advised them that I do not have a contract with XXXX and have NEVER had a contract with XXXX. An reinvestigation was opened in XXXX and completed in XXXX. Upon receipt of their findings asking me to contact XXXX, I attempted to do so. Once I explained to the "" XXXX '' the customer service rep that they were in violation of FL law she hung up on me. I contacted Equifax and requested that they send me the documentation that they used to validate the debt. I was advised that it was electronically validated by XXXX responding back to them for the item to "" remain. '' I am outraged at the lack knowledge that Equifax obviously have of the FDCPA. Per FDCPA, If a collection agency can not validate the debt, the credit bureau can not list it as a negative on your credit report. XXXX has NOT and CAN NOT validate this debt. They put this negative collection account on my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX, when their license in Florida expired XX/XX/XXXX. This was not an oversight, it was illegal as now that it has come to my attention, they will not validate, nor remove. They have violated FDCPA by not validating yet Equifax is still reporting it on my credit report. At this point Equifax is willfully and with malice negatively impacting my credit worthiness and sending this negative item on reports to all that I have sought credit from. In light of how this account has blemished my creditworthiness, I now hold Equifax just as responsible for reporting this incorrect and illegal collection. Per FDCPA, the credit reporting agency bears the responsibility of reporting only ACCURATE information. They have been advised that it is inaccurate and illegal yet they continue to report it.",Credit reporting

"Hello and thanks ahead of time for reading and/or offering any help. 
The story begins with a trip to XXXX XXXX. My wife and I had decided to take a trip XXXX and about three days into being in the country I got news that my credit card was compromised. Here I am, with my now-useless travel rewards card. So much for no foreign transaction fees. 
I call up Bank of America and ask them about what I can do. They offer to send me a new card but I 'm out of luck because my wife and I have to keep moving. We were hiking a trail and had to be certain places on certain days. No time to wait around and have a card delivered. 
I told Bank of America that I would n't bother and I 'd just use cash. They offered to waive my foreign transaction fees on my other credit card. They could n't change the terms, but they would put a note in my account and if I called up they would credit my account for the cost of the fees. 
The first month was annoying but alright. I called up they said it could n't be done, they led me around to supervisors until they dropped my call. I then called again ( immediately after ) and the first rep I talked to credited my account no problem. I had also been notified that I did n't need to call every month and that I could simply call up once when I got back to the XXXX. 
Now, here we are, 3 months later and I 'm back home in the XXXX with some time to call up BofA. The rep refuses to credit my account, says I agreed to the terms and conditions and that I agreed to fees. I explain the story, she says I ca n't be credited. She transfers me to a XXXX. I talk to the XXXX, same story. She tells me she see the note but the first time was a courtesy and they could n't do it again. I ask for someone higher up, they give me the run-around and say there is n't anyone else available. 
BofA lied to me. They took my money through fees that they promised to reimburse me. I only have some minor details recorded of who I talked to and when those conversations took place, but none of this is helping me. I feel helpless and quite frankly, used.",Credit / Prepaid card

"I have a mortgage loan with Flagstar Bank. On XXXX 2017 we had severe weather in which my home sustained damage from a storm. My insurance company performed estimates for repairs and I selected my contractors to complete the repairs. Flagstar was listed on my insurance checks and needs to sign them before I can deposit them to pay my contractors. To get the checks signed the bank requested several documents along with the endorsed checks. One of the documents they are requesting is a XXXX from my contractor. My contractors and I do n't see the bank 's need for this document as the bank is not making payments to them but rather just endorsing the checks so I can receive funds to cover the repairs. Four checks have been issued so far. The first was for {$14000.00}, Flagstar endorsed this check and returned it. The other three checks the bank requested : XXXX, repair proposal, Borrower Affidavit, lien waiver from contractors, proof of insurance and licensing. I was able to secure lien waivers from all the contractors, which are conditional on the checks clearing but the bank wants unconditional waivers which is not possible since the contractor wants to guarantee they receive the payment in full. The process of securing these documents took a long while as my contractors stated it was not a usual process, I have had contractors decline the work due to the excessive paperwork requested by my bank. From speaking to several employees, I was given different stories. I was told if I could n't provide XXXX 's I needed the waivers other times they wanted all the documents. Currently, three checks are with the bank. I sent in documentation showing I have paid the first contractor {$6800.00} in full and a completion certificate. The bank is still withholding the checks received recently with a whole packet of necessary documentation. Today the bank emailed me and they want to perform an inspection of the work completion and then release funds but I need to pay my contractor the initial funds to cover materials. The bank refuses to send an inspector to verify the completed work and wants all work completed before any inspection. I can not move forward while they hold my insurance funds hostage.  They amount of documentation requested is more than standard and has a negative effect on me as the home owner. Winter is almost here and if it snows, my tarp will not hold and additional damage will occur to my interior space which I will hold Flagstar responsible as it is their delay that lead to this point. All I want to do is repair my house. I welcome their inspection but they have to at least release funds for materials. From the initial check I have a little over {$8000.00} which is n't close to half the cost, the roof alone was {$9000.00} before the porch, deck, gutters, window etc. The bank 's policy has a negative impact on my ability to complete repairs on time to solve this whole issue. I do n't have over {$25000.00} sitting around to pay the contractor and wait on the bank to reimburse me which is what they have suggested as a work around. I have had mortgages before and this is by far the most difficult bank policies I have dealt with on release of insurance funds for repairs. I have signed affidavit 's that repairs will be done, my mortgage is current, evidence of repairs being done is available and still they delay the process costing me time and money. My energy bills are sky high as the trap offers no insulation from heat let a lone the cold winter weather on its way. The bank 's policies are strictly to favor the bank at the expense of good consumers. I have had several discussions on this with employees and managers and nothing has improved or changed. Nobody deserve this kind of treatment when I have n't given them reason to doubt my character. My mortgage loan will be transferred as soon as this fiasco is resolved.

"In XX/XX/XXXX our home was flooded by Hurricane Harvey, almost 15 months ago. Since that time we have been paying monthly rent to live in an apartment in addition to paying our monthly mortgage payment since the home is uninhabitable. We have not missed nor have been delayed on any payments. The City of XXXX declared our home substantially damaged, which means that we are required to elevate the existing XXXX house in order to receive City permits for renovation, or we must tear the house down and build a new, elevated home. We have opted to tear the house down and build a new, elevated home because costs to elevate the existing house and complete post-flood renovations are estimated to cost $ 350,000- {$400000.00} or more. 
Our flood insurance claim of {$150000.00} was settled in XX/XX/XXXX. We owe approximately {$230000.00} on our existing mortgage, which will leave a remaining balance of approximately {$82000.00}. 
The issue we face with Freedom Mortgage is that they are holding the insurance claim funds in escrow despite our repeated requests to apply the funds to the payoff of the mortgage. 
I have spoken to numerous representatives in their Customer Care Center and in the Loss department. We have made numerous requests over many weeks/months. I have spoken to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and likely others. No single person takes ownership over our case, which means we must explain our request brand new to every person. When I have asked to speak to the same employee again, I am told the person is busy or unavailable. 
They tell us that we should pay the remaining balance of approximately {$82000.00}, at which point they will apply the insurance funds to the balance of the mortgage. But they refuse to issue an official payoff letter nor provide this process in writing. In my attempts to receive what we need, I have requested and have received two official payoff letters from them. Both state the full amount of the loan, approximately {$230000.00}. 
We have been approved at another bank for a new construction loan, and they will assume the remaining balance of our current mortgage in our new construction loan, but they can not do this without a formal payoff letter that states the true payoff amount of approximately {$82000.00} and a clear statement that in paying this amount, the lien will be clear. 
At one point I even called Freedom to make the payment myself, desperate to move past this, and I asked for instructions on how to wire the funds. The Freedom employee I spoke to was uncomfortable giving me the instructions due to concern that the Loss department would not apply the flood insurance money to the remaining balance. She, herself a Freedom Mortgage employee, did not want to move forward as she was worried that we would make the large payment of funds without guarantee that they would pay off the loan with the funds held in escrow.

We think that Freedom Mortgage is acting unethically. They have zero motivation to apply the flood insurance funds to our loan. Every month they collect a mortgage payment from us, and they are likely collecting interest on the flood insurance funds held in escrow as well.

"I am XXXX XXXX XXXX ; I have a home mortgage loan with Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc. I am wishing to file a complaint against this company concerning questionable mortgage practices such as irrational fees applied to my account to keep me in late on my payments : Suspense payments fee BPO fees Property valuation fees Property Inspection fees Prior Servicers fees Late fees Late escrow fees I have carefully comb through my statements, receipts, and contract trying to find a logical reason for all these fees and nothing, then again, even the company reason is questionable to me. 
Additionally, Ocwen Financial has misinformed me about many of my rights as a customer. Countless years my mortgage payments has been placed in an escrow account that I HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO. My statements show surges in my monthly payments, surges in escrow payments and unapplied funds. Because of these surges, I made yet another call to Ocwen. 

According to the many conversation, I have had with Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc, Customer Care Center. The company explains that they had to pay my home insurance out of my escrow account therefore, making the escrow account short. Triggering a reduction in my house payment consequently transferring it to unapplied funds until a whole payment. This is how Ocwen has round up thousands of dollars in IRRATIONAL FEES. 

The requirements to withdraw from the escrow account is to have your house payments, house insurance, plus home taxes all current at the time you ask to be discharge from the escrow account. XX/XX/2016, I made three-house payments totaling nearly {$2000.00} more than I owed just to be on the safe side. I called Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc, Customer Care Center requesting to be removed from the escrow account. 

Ocwen Customer Care Center explains they need to research my escrow requirements then contact me later. XX/XX/XXXX Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc, Customer Care Center sent me a letter stating my escrow waiver request was denied coupled with the statement the escrow is still required on your loan Furthermore, let me be clear I believe my issues concerns fraudulent practices committed by Ocwen in connection with its home mortgage loans. I believe the company was and still is being malice, misrepresentative and manipulative towards it customers. In my research, this is what I came to realize. Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc, goal is to keep the homeowner late or in default. 

Combined, monthly payments coupled with the revenue generated from fee inflation each month times millions of customers is goal mine.

8.June payment what 's left of it is sitting in Unapplied funds collecting interest {$560.00} What has to be the most disturbing is The Deed of trust, which allows Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc to run a scheme in the event the obligator fails to meet their commitments. Which goes back to the point I made above reference to exorbitant amount of fee being generate by way of deceptive practices. 

Finally, Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc has me last on all my bills, I ca n't keep this up much longer I 'm asking for any help legal your agency can provide. I have tried searching for legal help however, the fees or too high or case to small. I would like an investigation into Ocwen Financial Servicing LLc if possible, I would like the fees stopped, to have my fixed payments to remain the same as in contract and close the escrow account.",Mortgage

"I have submitted several complaints to all three credit bureaus, the CFPB, the BBB of Michigan and the original creditor in regards to an ongoing dispute. Please see complaint below : I originally purchased a vehicle for a 12-month lease on XX/XX/XXXX. Once the 12-month lease was up, I had the option to either turn the vehicle in and they will bill me the disposition fee or take it out of my original down payment of {$900.00}, or if I still needed the vehicle, I would have to put down another down payment for an additional 12 months. I opted to return the vehicle, which I was informed by the account rep that I had until XX/XX/XXXX to return the car without any additional fees being added. The account rep also informed me that if there was any damage or additional fees ( disposition fee ) that it would be taken out of my initial down payment or I would be billed for whatever amount remained.
When I returned the vehicle on or about XX/XX/XXXX ( I had purchased another vehicle several days prior ) I was also informed at the dealership upon returning, that if there were any additional fees that were not covered by my initial down payment that I would be billed.
1 year later, I checked my credit report and the finance company, Brite Financial Services has recorded a charge off amount of $ XXXXwith a monthly payment of {$78.00} on my on all three credit files ( XXXX , XXXX , XXXX  ).
My agreement was for 12 months with the option to lease again at the end of my 12 months and a monthly payment of {$150.00}. As of XX/XX/XXXX, this company was paid a total of {$7000.00} from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This vehicle was returned on time with no additional monies owed. In addition, per the lease agreement ( see attached ), the total payments paid at the end of the lease was to be {$4800.00}. Therefore, this lease agreement has been paid in full per the documentation provided.
Furthermore, I contacted the company in XX/XX/XXXX to ask for my credit report to be adjusted from the amount owed/charged off amount of {$6300.00} to be corrected. The account manager then informed me that the amount that is seen is what was financed and not owed. At this point the finance company is refusing to correct their issue. I am requesting VALIDATION of this account. This means that the creditor is to send me a complete payment history to show that a payment is actually owed.
I have sent complaints to all three credit bureaus, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the creditor with on success. Please look into this matter and verify the account as being falsely reported.
In addition, I have only received handwritten/typed account information stating what is owed. This is not proper VALIDATION, as this information can be from any one of their current or previous customer 's information. Brite Financial as also sent back dated emails with previous amount owed.

"I opened a Discover Bank Checking and Savings account on XX/XX/XXXX. I transferred {$5.00} from my XXXX checking account for the initial opening of both accounts, which was received and accepted on XX/XX/XXXX, I had also scheduled for {$50.00} to be sent to the new account on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that both accounts have been suspended and to call immediately, which I did. Upon calling them, I was told the accounts were n't suspended, but actually closed and the initial {$5.00} would be sent back to the issuing bank and the {$50.00} that was in the process of being transferred would be rejected and sent back to the issuing bank, as well. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and none of the money has been sent back. I called them today to find out why the money had not been returned to my issuing bank. I was told a variety of stories : 1. The issuing bank had to send a letter of indemnity to Discover in order to return the funds. When I asked why, I was told it was policy. I explained I had been told in the last phone exchange that the money would not even be accepted, so I should n't have to jump through this hoop. I asked for a supervisor. 
2. XXXX, the supervisor, continued to say that it was policy to get the letter of indemnification. I asked for the policy that dictates this. She led me to the National Deposit Account Agreement online, wherein it states that "" We can close your Account at any time for any reason, including if the balance in your Account is zero. If we close your Account, funds on deposit will be disbursed to the Accountholder ( s ). '' I asked XXXX where it says anything about a letter of indemnification. She said it 's policy to require it. I told her she was a liar and wasted my time. I explained I could understand if they had policies in place to guarantee that I was me if I wanted them to send me a check, but I only wanted the money returned to the account from whence it came. I was n't asking them to return it directly to me, so they would have no loss and would therefore, not need a letter of indemnity 3. On a subsequent phone call ( we were disconnected ) to XXXX, she stated that when their "" investigation '' was done and the letter received, they could release funds. I said, "" What investigation? '' She said I was being investigated for fraud and that was why they needed the letter. She refused to tell me what prompted this investigation. I told her this sounded like a ruse to avoid releasing funds since it has not been mentioned in ANY other correspondence or communication. It was unlikely that I was committing fraud for {$50.00}!

"SYNCHRONY BANK is synonymous with INSANE. PLEASE CFPB do something about this ATROCIOUS entity. I am positive I am not the only one with issues with them! 

I am STILL ( yes, complained many times before ) not having payments applied inline with policies or what any RED BLOODED AMERICAN would expect!!! 

I have multiple promotional balances. I have been told time and again, plus per their site policies, payments are applied to the MOST RECENT EXPIRING PROMOTION. And furthermore in conversation with Synchrony on many occasions, the LARGEST balance. I was literally told, "" we want to apply payments that best serve you and save you interest whenever possible '' I have TWO balances expiring XX/XX/XXXX. My minimum payment was {$25.00}. Paid {$100.00}. 

I had a current charge for a book at {$11.00}, that should result in {$88.00} being applied to my BIGGEST balance expiring XX/XX/XXXX. 

Instead, {$83.00} was applied to the largest balance expiring XX/XX/XXXX, and {$2.00} applied to the next in line expiring XX/XX/XXXX - which, no I can't really complain as they both expire XX/XX/XXXX. 

BUT!!!! Where I ABSOLUTELY have an issue is with your APPLYING {$0.00} cents to a promotion expiring XX/XX/XXXX, AND {$0.00} cents to a promotion expiring XX/XX/XXXX, AND {$1.00} to a promotion expiring XX/XX/XXXX AND {$0.00} cents to a promotion expiring XX/XX/XXXX, AND {$1.00} to a promotion expiring XX/XX/XXXX Just what purpose does applying payment to balance NOT due until XX/XX/XXXX do to benefit my balance ( s ) expiring XX/XX/XXXX??? It ONLY does one thing. Places Synchrony in a MUCH GREATER POTENTIAL whereby a member does NOT pay off their promotional balance in full which then causes ALL INTEREST in suspense to become due and payable. What a payday for you all. To date on the two XX/XX/XXXX balances, there is over {$160.00} in accured DEFERRED interest. 

This is a RECURRING scenario with Synchrony. It is not acceptable and should not be tolerated. I know this is a SYNCHRONY INTERNAL ERROR they REFUSE to address. I have this SAME issue with my XXXX 's card that is regretably also issued by Synchrony and it too has promotional balances NOT applied properly. 

At the end of the day, YES, I do and will pay my balances in full. However, by Synchrony CHOOSING to apply the payments in any XXXX fashion they so choose, and moreover apply to time period due further into the future, it literally ROBS from the consumer the ability to truly DEFER payments over 6 months. ( or whatever the term ) And NO calling in to make a payment, is simply not a solution to this problem. This is a problem THAT CAN BE FIXED in programing and payment application. In fact, when I called in two months ago in a point of complete exasperation, I had a Synchrony agent ask, "" Why do you want to pay that balance now? '' - REALLY?? What they XXXX business is it of an agent why I am paying a balance? 

Lastly, and this may be an issue with XXXX, which I have contacted them directly, but when someone buys multiple items in ONE TRANSACTION and then defers the balance, it results in literally as many individual promotional balances as items in the total transaction! So this time last year, I bought about a dozen and half gift cards for XXXX gifts, and I literally was hit with over 24 individual promotional balances!! I'd make a payment of {$100.00} and that was spread UNEVENLY over 24 balances!!! STUPID.",Credit / Prepaid card

My limit is {$500.00}. Today I check my account to see that my balance was {$570.00} which would put me over the limit. I was told by a representative that I continued to use my card after the available balance was gone which is false. I charges go through immediately and my available balance is updated immediately after my card is used. There is no way that any charged could have gone through after that available balance was at XXXX it would have automatically denied. All of those transactions were done in person and would have declined.

"Hello, My husband and I recently sold our house and as part of the negotiation process reached an agreement that we would pay closing costs not to exceed {$4600.00}. We noticed on the closing disclosure that we could get more information or make a complaint on www.consumerfinance.gov/mortgage-closing.

We received two offers at the same time ( one with closing costs not to exceed {$2000.00} and one with closing costs not to exceed {$4600.00} ), but there were other variables that contributed to us accepting the latter offer. Please note that prior to these offers, we had two other offers with closing costs ( both {$3000.00} ) - the first rejected our counteroffer and the second fell through after the inspection process because of buyer financing. Throughout the selling process, we were told closing costs should run about {$3000.00} and even after accepting this offer, we knew that costs should be less than the amount negotiated ( seldom is it ever going to be the exact amount ). Considering discussions with relators that have conducted several recent transactions, XXXX and our own recent house buying and selling experience, these closing costs do not appear to be competitive and feels like we paid for something else.

"Pentagon Federal Credit Union ( PenFed ), a creditor named in my XXXX XXXX Bankruptcy petition on XXXX ( secured by car title ), is reporting inaccurate information to the national credit bureaus. In doing so, PenFed is violating the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, and 7-year reporting limit of the Fair Credit Reporting Act by willfully misrepresenting facts, refusing to correct errors, and using the credit bureau reports as a collection tactic in a manner that is contrary to these regulatory statutes. 

Pentagon Federal Credit Union Acct. # 1 : The last payment made on this account was prior to filing bankruptcy in XXXX XXXX, when the account was also closed. However, the initial date of delinquency was in XXXX. While I have no knowledge of any activity on the account after XXXX XXXX, PenFed has reported a "" last payment date '' in XXXX XXXX. 
My XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX reports show an estimated removal date of XXXX XXXX ; then the XXXX XXXX XXXX report shows an estimated removal of XXXX XXXX ; but XXXX is now telling me this derogatory account will remain on record until XXXX XXXX. Again, my last activity on this account was in XXXX XXXX. 
I have contacted PenFed, XXXX, and XXXX regarding this mysterious "" last payment date '' but none will correct the date or remove the account. In a conversation on XXXX XXXX, XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX, a supervisor at the XXXX U.S. Consumer Relations Center, XXXX XXXX said his company would not remove this derogatory account until XXXX XXXX because PenFed has reported XXXX XXXX as the "" last payment date ''. This confirmed in a subsequent call with XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX Consumer Relations ' on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires derogatory accounts be removed 7 years from the initial late payment date, which preceded XXXX XXXX. The fictitious "" last payment date '' of XXXX XXXX that PenFed arbitrarily created and refuses to remove has extended the length of this record to almost 9 years. 

Pentagon Federal Credit Union Acct. # 2 : A reaffirmation agreement was signed during the pending bankruptcy for the above described car loan, with a first payment date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Although I made multiple calls to PenFed requesting an account number and billing statement for the new loan, I was always told it was in process of being set-up. Without an account number or bill, no payments were made. 
In XXXX XXXX, PenFed sent the title to the car ( securitizing the loan ), along with a letter stating the account was paid in full and closed. The reaffirmation agreement was subsequently cancelled ( rescinded ) by notice to the court and creditor, and accepted by the court XXXX years before the bankruptcy was discharged. 
Many years later, I saw that PenFed had reported to the credit bureaus that a secured account was opened in XXXX XXXX, with an initial timely payment made followed by 2 consecutive months of delinquencies, and no other entries. PenFed is now reporting to the credit bureaus that the account remains open with an outstanding balance of {$10000.00}. 
This account should be removed from the credit bureaus because I had no knowledge of the account 's existence or activities ; the reaffirmation agreement was rescinded in proceedings of the U.S. Bankruptcy court in a timely and legal manner ; and the attached letter from PenFed shows the loan was Paid in Full and closed, with the underlying security interest ( lien on title to car ) released to me. 

Note : the account number shown on PenFed 's letter is my credit union member number, and account numbers on the credit reports are suffices thereof.",Other
"Optimum Outcomes called me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for the second time about the same visit. The first call was on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for a hospital visit on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that I did not receive a bill for. I paid that balance of {$94.00}. I received a call today saying that I owed {$21.00} for the same visit. I had received no written communication about this debt until today when I asked for it via email. 

I initially tried to dispute it but was told I could not. They said that the bill was entered into collections is XXXX XXXX and that the bill was reported to the credit bureaus in XXXX XXXX. I could not see this on any of my credit reports provided by annualcreditreport.com I called again to ask for this information in a written format, and they said that they would provide it. The new customer service representative told me that I could dispute it, but that it could n't be removed from my credit report unless it was paid and the creditor agreed to it. She then said that it was normal for it to not show up on my credit report because it was a basic report and that the information they reported could only be seen if you pulled a major credit report such as for an auto loan or for a mortgage. She agreed to put it in dispute for notification and then told me that if I agreed to pay, they would be able to remove it from my credit report within 30-45 days, and that they could send me a letter to dispute with the credit bureaus to speed up this process since I was meeting with a mortgage broker within a week. 

I relented because {$22.00} was n't worth it to me to cost me a potential mortgage, and I then paid, even though I still am unsure why the debt was not paid in XXXX XXXX when they told me I had paid in full for the visit. I received my letter from them asking the credit bureaus to delete the negative information, but the credit bureau dispute forms do not allow me to do so because it is not listed as any information to dispute. This leaves me under the impression that I was given false information concerning my credit report in order to get me to pay a debt that I wish to dispute and that I was not informed about until today. 

I spoke with representatives of TransUnion who told me that the information provided me online was accurate and that there were no collections on my credit report and that everything I was seeing online was the what a lender would see. This confirms for me that this was never actually reported to the credit bureaus and was just a tactic being used to get me to settle a small debt quickly that I do not think I actually owed.",Debt collection

In XX/XX/XXXX we figured out that XXXX sold our mortgage to Carrington Mortgage after we received a loan modification agreement from Carrington Mortgage Services. but we were shocked by the numbers of the amounts we owed so we wanted to do more inquiry before signing the document. Our loan did not show credit for any payments made since XXXX and we had 4 years of undocumented payments with no credit to us or acknowledgement that we had made them. They were pushing us to sign the document and we did not agree with the balances shown. We just wanted to negotiate and understand the terms of the loan and come to some agreement so that we could receive some credit for our many payments. Carrington would not negotiate with us or listen to us and just said they were going ahead with foreclosure. We then got a letter dated XXXX that they were foreclosing and a sheriffs sale was set for XXXX. We did not understand as we were not delinquent at this time and our loan was in good standing with XXXX. Carrington told us XXXX no longer exists and they now own our mortgage. So in desperation, We again filed for bankruptcy on XXXX to save our home. We filed for another modification in XX/XX/XXXX. When I asked again if I could negotiate or have someone answer questions regarding payments that were not applied to the loan, Carrington suggested we submit a Customer Service Research Request, I did that on XX/XX/XXXX. In the meantime we started another modification as they told us we had an XXXX sale date. I was so confused at this time, I was not sure what to do but continued on to submit the Customer service claim and also the Modification AGAIN. Then we were told our modification was denied. I am still not sure what they decided on investigation although they sent a letter I do not understand. We now have a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

We have completed several loan modifications, multiple sale dates, which we have been fighting al this time. We had an independent review and after contacting HUD at one point, our home was sold but HUD made them undo the sale after it was sold. I just want a loan with a fair payment and We have been obstructed from doing so by so many companies. We have had so many foreclosures with sale dates that our legal fees are almost as much as the principal owed. We have more fees owed for interest and late payments that we owe more in fees than the principal owed on the home. We just want to work out a fair deal. This is not a case of us not making payments but to many servicers not communicating or acknowledging payments or blocking us from making them. These fees are unfair and very unclear. I have boxes of documents to prove all of these facts and also checks documented from our local bank proving the checks were cashed and payments were made. 

Please help us, We have been in this home almost 30 years. Our business is here on the property. We have done everything servicers have asked and there must be a way to make this right. We just want to pay our mortgage. I have boxes of documents to prove all of these facts and also checks documented from our local bank proving the checks were cashed and payments were made.",Mortgage

"I am receiving letters from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage saying that I owe all these fees. 
I have never been late on a payment, I pay the mortgage at the bank and get a receipt each time so I know that they have received all the payments. The property is a rental condo and they have never called me to have an inspection. The outside of the condo is maintained by the Homeowner 's Association so I do not know why I was charged for inspections of the condo when I am not even responsible for the maintenance of the condo building. There are also multiple attorney fees on their statement and I do not know why they needed an attorney and why I am being charged attorney fees. 
Years ago I spoke with someone at the local branch of Wells Fargo and I thought this was resolved and they said I did not owe anything but I keep getting bills from them. 
There have been class action lawsuits about this very same thing so it seems that they are charging a lot of other people fees that they do not owe. Please do something about this as I should not have to start another class action lawsuit to stop them from charging fees that are not necessary and have nothing to do with my loan. 
I am attaching the letter with the breakdown of the fees that they sent to me and also a copy of a letter I received about a class action lawsuit but I did not do anything about it at that time because I did not know that they would be charging me all these fees. 
These big banks received money from the taxpayers and the government so why do they need to collect more money when it is n't even necessary to do these inspections and they do not need all of these attorneys either, especially when someone pays their mortgage every month. This has to end. They are getting away with charging fees to lots of people and it adds up to a lot of money as many people just pay it to stop the harassment but it is wrong so please do something to stop the abuse of power Thank you.",Mortgage

"Due to an unfortunate change in my financial circumstances, I was forced to pursue a short sale of my home. This process began in XX/XX/XXXX. After several months, I was able to obtain approval for the sale from my XXXX lender ( XXXX and XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I was also finally able to obtain an approval letter from my XXXX lender, Suntrust, on XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ). Right before my closing, my buyer backed out of the sale because of a serious illness in his family. The home was re-listed on XX/XX/XXXX and a new contract was reached with another buyer on XX/XX/XXXX. Almost immediately, I was able to substitute the new buyer and HUD-1 for the old XXXX with the XXXX lender, who was using XXXX to handle the approval. XXXX sent me a new approval letter on XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) approving the sale, and REQUIRING A CLOSING NO LATER THAN XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, my XXXX lender, Suntrust, determined that the change in buyers amounted to an "" all new '' short sale application. I had to provide them with a completely new application form, financial records, tax returns, and more, despite the fact that they had approved the identical transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. Since that time, Suntrust has continually "" lost '' documents that have been sent to them, or advised me on XXXX day that XXXX of the pages of the XXXX Uniform Borrower 's Assistance Form had become "" hard to read '' or was n't dark enough, and that I needed to resend it, only to tell me the next day that a different line of the same page needed to be darkened.

I do not know if what Suntrust is doing is intentional or simply grossly incompetent, but I and XXXX agree that it is unacceptable treatment of a distressed homeowner, particularly when Suntrust itself previously approved this identical short sale on XX/XX/XXXX. If Suntrust 's continued delays push my closing past the XX/XX/XXXX deadline set by XXXX, I have been told by XXXX that it will have to resubmit everything to XXXX, which could delay or even destroy my short sale.

The vendor refused to provide a refund and stated that he would only be able to do so AFTER he shipped the item to me and I was able to return it to him. I filed a dispute with Citi Credit Cards and received a provisional credit while they conducted their investigation. I provided them with all the information that they requested, except for once I accidently forgot to include an attachment, so the investigation was closed. Citi agreed to re-open the case after I provided the information that was missing from a previous email.

So, now, Citi Credit Cards is making me pay for merchandise that I do not have because the vendor, who was unscrupulous to begin with, is saying that he did not receive return shipment, which, if it is true, may very well have been by design. 
Is there no law against having to pay for merchandise that I did not receive, especially, when the Vendor shipped the items against my will - and I have done EVERYTHING in my power to return the items back to him? Should n't Citi Credit Cards be obligated to write this off to their "" bad debt '' account, as opposed to forcing me to pay for a good that I do not have and did not want? I believe that it is unfair to put me in the position of proving that the VENDOR is not telling the truth ( that he did receive the package ), when they have no proof to the contrary - other than his statement. Should n't they be giving me ( their customer ) the benefit of the doubt OVER a vendor with whom they have no other ties?

Section 1391, because one or more of the Defendants maintains executive offices in or conducts business in the district relevant to where real estate is located in this concern.The interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending enumerates certain tactics that may indicate predatory lending. Nonprofit groups have also published widely accepted guidance on the kinds of practices that may constitute predatory lending. Predatory loans typically combine risky loan features, thereby placing the borrower at an excessive risk of default or foreclosure. 
For purposes of this Complaint, "" Combined-Risk Loans '' are loans that meet the definition of high-cost loan under HMDA. HMDA, which is an extension of The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act ( HOEPA ) and enacted XX/XX/XXXX as an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) to address abusive practices in refinancing and home-equity mortgage loans with high interest rates or high fees. Loans that meet HOEPA 's high-cost coverage tests are subject to special disclosure requirements and restrictions on loan terms, and borrowers in high-cost mortgages1 have enhanced remedies for violations of the law.

XXXX XXXX is also a creditor as that term is defined by section 702 ( e ) of the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( e ), and is, therefore, subject to the requirements of the ECOA and its implementing Regulation B, as amended, 12 C.F.R. Part 202, in effect on or after XX/XX/XXXX.The provisions of TILA, including HOEPA, are implemented in the Bureau 's Regulation Z. and also contain XXXX or more of the following high risk terms : ( a ) the loan was issued based upon the "" stated income, '' rather than the verified income, of the borrower ; ( b ) the debt-to-income ratio exceeds 55 % ; of the actual income ( c ) the loan-to-value ratio is at least 125 % based on the values at time of closing ; ( d ) the loan has no appraisal report which is required to determine how much money can be borrowed against the property ( e ) the loan has no 3 day right to rescission addendum ( f ) the loan possess no HUD 1 Settlement Statement ( g ) the loan imposed prepayment penalties. Individually, this loans feature made my mortgage loan riskier and more costly. When multiple features are layered within the same loan, the riskiness and costliness of the loans increase dramatically. A loan 's debt-to-income ratio ( "" DTI '' ) is a primary bellwether of the borrower 's ability to meet the loan 's terms. The level of risk associated with high DTIs was exacerbated by the prevalence of high interest loan of 10.99 %.

During various conversations with XXXX XXXX, I have been given information which has varied, to say the least. I was informed that if my account did not reach 120 days late ( which it had not ) it would not be reported to the credit bureaus. I aggressively paid down the balance which has been paid in full.

I was recently informed, without notice, that the account had been cancelled and reported as such to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX by XXXX XXXX despite previous representations that it would not be reported. With this derogatory information on my credit, it could cripple my business.

"Please see the below letter, written by my wife, regarding the HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE that we are having with Stearns. It's an absolute joke, the time and effort we have had to put into trying to get back penalties that we were forced to pay when we had to pay two tax bills out of our own pocket. Isn't that what escrow is for? We have been MORE than patient with Stearns, trying to get our funds back. We are at the end of our rope and don't know what else to do to get the situation resolved. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact me via email or phone. 

We have had a bad experience ( since XX/XX/XXXX ) with Stearns making sure our taxes are paid on time with our escrow funds. It has been very hectic and stressful following up with Stearns as many times as we have, trying to get the situation resolved. It started in XX/XX/XXXX when we were mailed a surplus escrow check that was over {$5000.00}. We immediately knew something was wrong and called customer service. The agent we spoke with ensured us that the check was correct, stating all of our three tax bills for the year had been paid. We cashed the check but knew the situation was not correct. In XX/XX/XXXX, it was brought to our attention that we had a large tax bill that was so past due, it was in the penalty phase. We contacted Stearns right away, asking that the bill be paid as soon as possible. Customer service asked us to submit a copy of the bill and we did so. We gave Stearns some time to review the bill and pay it. By this time, we were into XXXX and the bill still hadnt been paid. We became concerned the bill wasnt going to be paid before XX/XX/XXXX, when the bill would have gone to collections. So, we ended up paying the tax bill out of our own pocket, using the money from the escrow surplus check we received. In addition to this, we had to pay for all of the penalties that were associated with the bill. In addition to this, there was another tax bill that Stearns failed to pay. It was a much smaller bill, but it was also late and had late fees associated with it. I also paid for this bill out of pocket. This was an interim tax bill that Stearns claims they arent responsible for paying. However, I have spoken to agents at the tax office who said that IT IS Stearns responsibility to pay interim tax bills. The total for the penalties alone, between the two bills, was around {$800.00}. To date, XX/XX/XXXX, I have been trying relentlessly to get these penalties refunded to me. So far, not a single customer service agent has been able to explain to me why these tax bills werent paid on time. I have called Customer Service numerous times and continuously get the run around agents promising to call me back with follow up information or saying they will have their supervisor call me and even saying the tax department will reach out to me to get the situation resolved. Im at my wits end and dont know what else to do. Im fed up with the whole process and lack of communication that Stearns has provided me with.",Mortgage
"I 've had an American Express Serve card for at least a year, maybe longer. I got the AMEX XXXX ( prepaid ) card because there are NO FEES, which is wonderful.

That {$300.00} is used to pay for food items, so until last week, that is all I had ever used the card for. But last week, I bought {$20.00} of gas ( paying at the pump ) with the AMEX XXXX card. Before I started pumping the gas, I checked my card balance, which was about {$95.00}. I bought {$20.00} in gas. Next thing I know, I get a "" Low Balance '' email alert from AMEX advising that my card balance is ZERO!!!!! That 's because the gas station charged my card {$100.00} for {$20.00} in gas!!!!!!!

After keeping me on hold for 10 minutes, the AMEX rep came back and said they issued a refund of my money but that I can not use the AMEX XXXX card to pay for gas AT THE PUMP ; you have to pay for gas INSIDE the store.

"Good Morning : To whom it may concern : I am requesting that this Claim be reopened and that XXXX should be reviewed with accuracy and diligence. I have not been given the chance to argue the validity of this claim because we just received our letter from B of A this week. By that time B of A already closed this claim. That is a great in justice considering how long you had the case open, never the less I have evidence that I could have presented to B of A to prove my innocence. I can not get the necessary information to fully defend myself from B of A or XXXX IE all information on all items that I am claiming fraud for and old account information from XXXX which showed the items being ordered what I have ordered, profile information to include the email of the perpetrator and fraudulent information that was entered by the perpetrator before my account was re-established on XX/XX/XXXX because XXXX has taken this information off my account and it is no longer viewable. I am requesting that B of A demand this information from XXXX based on disclosing necessary information based on the freedom of information act. 
The first thing I want to talk about is where I was during the time these purchases were made. It would be impossible for me to have made any type of order from the XXXX to the XXXX of XXXX because I was on a long range fishing trip out of XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX from XXXX AM on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX AM on the XXXX as noted by page XXXX of the enclosed documents to include the Manifest, the Receipt for the trip, and an email from XXXX XXXX stating there was no internet service where the boat went which was over XXXX miles due West from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have also enclosed a leave request to go on vacation to fish out of XXXX XXXX and it is digitally signed by my boss XXXX XXXX. If you have any more questions about this please contact XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX or my boss at XXXX. As noted on XXXX number XXXX the order was placed on XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/2018. This also means that I would have not been there for pick up on the delivery date of XX/XX/2018. I have also never used overnight shipping or accelerated ( Express ) shipping. I have also never ordered multiple items in this qty. I have also never placed such a large order in $ amount that was done on this order that is part of the profile of this order. Does not fit me and it was not me. Also, the emails sent to work address never allowed me to address these items being ordered. The perpetrator ordered the items on the XXXX and received the items on the XXXX where he picked them up at my address either off the front porch or off of the truck. The delivery trucks in my neighborhood have been delivering items to people just standing outside in front of house without checking ids or where they live from time to time also. I came back from the fishing trip on the XXXX of XXXX a Sunday and returned to work on the XXXX of XXXX By this time it was too late for me to address these issues. I would have not been looking for these items either since I did know they were ordered because I was on a fishing trip. 
The second thing I would like to address is the fact that XXXX knows my account was compromised. Monday on the XXXX when I got back to work from my fishing trip and looked at the unauthorized purchases on my bank account, I called XXXX. I also tried to log in on XXXX at which time I could not because the perpetrator changed the password and other items ( such as my email to his email because I saw it after I got to log in with the aid of XXXX ) in my profile. I told XXXX about this so they should know that my account was compromised. XXXX then verified who I was and then helped me to restore my account. I have 5 emails from XXXX showing the perpetrator trying to get into my account before he ordered the merchandise and I was on the fishing trip. After the 5th time of password resets the perpetrator starting ordering the merchandise. I would have addressed the password resets with temporary passwords if I was at work on the XXXX but I was on the fishing trip and the emails were sent to my work email. I am enclosing these emails pages 6-10 of the enclosed documents. Page 6 shows the perpetrator trying log in and having problems at XXXX am on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, therefore ; a password reset was sent to my email at work at which time I was on the fishing trip. It also mentions in page 6 that the perpetrator answered the security questions wrong and was denied. But it mentioned that the perpetrator should call for assistance. Page 7 shows the perpetrator trying to attempt to register his device on my account. He was also having problems doing this at XXXX am on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX which still places me on the fishing trip. XXXX provided a temp password to my email account which the perpetrator did not get because it was sent to my work email and I was on the fishing trip. Page 8 shows again the perpetrator having problems registering a device at XXXX XXXX on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX this is the same scenario as found on page 7. I was on the fishing trip. Page 9 is similar also done at XXXX am on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX. I was on the fishing trip. Page 10 also is the same as page 8 done at XXXX am on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX. I was on the fishing trip. 
Page 11 will show the perpetrator attempting to order a gift card for XXXX dollars. This was not allowed by XXXX, never the less an attempt was made by the same perpetrator at XXXX pm on the XXXX of XXXX once again I was on the fishing trip. This order also shows an email I do not recognize of XXXX. XXXX recognize this email never used it. Who is this? 
Page 12 will show the perpetrator trying to order a XXXX $ gift card. I was never charged this but I just wanted to bring up the phone number on this order of XXXX XXXX be worth investigating. I have not tried to call this number either because I do not want to tip this person off! Why was this sent to this phone number who is this? Never the less, it was ordered under my account because I got the email for it. It was done on the XXXX of XXXX PM which at this time I had reset my account and re-established with XXXX I dont get this one who is this? 
Now, I want to discuss the receipt of the items on which a confirmation email was sent to my email which I was not aware of because I was on the fishing trip and did not see these emails until I got back to work on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX on my work email. The perpetrator used my account and had them delivered to my address and either got them off of the XXXX or off of my front porch. I dont know but I dont have these items and never ordered them! Plus my wife was at her Mother in Laws from the morning until the evening of the XXXX of XXXX when the items got delivered because she wanted to spend time with her mother I will submit a statement from her mother and boyfriend stating she was at their house when the items got delivered. She would have stayed at home if we knew that these items where coming in, but we had no way of knowing that because somebody else ordered these items not me not my wife and emails were sent to my work email that were delivered to my work email while I was out fishing! Page 13 XXXX camera arriving the XXXX. Do not have the tracking number because B of A only sent me the tracking number and details for the XXXX DVD player. Dont have this item and never ordered it. It would help if I had complete information on all of the items tracking number and when they were bought this information has not been made available to me which should be disclosed to me by rights of the freedom of information act. How can I prove my case on incomplete data /information provided to me to me by B of A!!!! I am not going to discuss all of items they are all similar to page 13, however I can discuss order number XXXX XXXX Audio DVD Player for {$100.00} ( Pages 14-17 ) because this is the only item out of 9 items I get to respond to because B of A only sent me information on this item. First of all the order date was XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX. I was fishing. Second, item delivered on XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I was fishing and my wife was staying with her mother in law from the morning until the evening I will provide a letter from my mother in law and her boyfriend stating that she was there. Third, XXXX XXXX, as stated earlier the perpetrator was trying to register devices as noted on page 6-10 so is it out of the question to assume that in the long run he got to register his device and order the merchandise with his device and also change the password and email in my profile. I also checked my router IP with check my I.P. on the internet that is connected to my router and what came up was XXXX. XXXX, therefore ; I would challenge XXXX on the possibility that this IP belongs to a different device/router than mine because I have emails that shows the perpetrator trying to register devices under my account. Next, XXXX knows when I got back on the XXXX that my account was compromised, I could not even log in and there was information changed in my profile like an email that I did not even recognize. XXXX has deleted all the information from the ordering of this merchandise from my account and I can not talk to the fraud department at XXXX. I demand once again that B of A request all old information pertaining to this merchandise and my account as it was before I could check it and re-establish my account on the XXXX of XX/XX/2018 from XXXX. The only thing they can tell me to do is to put in a claim with my bank ( B of A ) once again this is a violation of the freedom of information act. Since these unauthorized charges occurred on my account, XXXX reestablished my account with me with a different password on the XXXX of XXXX XXXX. Next, I noticed on the last page of the documentation that it says that the Carrier ( XXXX ) was notified to pick up package? Was this somebody telling XXXX to pick up the package so it could be delivered? Finally, on the provided documentation last page it says item delivered on XXXX XXXX at XXXX PM. My wife was at her Mother in Laws which once again I will provide a statement for that, and I was fishing. My wife would have been at home if she was expecting a package for sure we do not let items lay on our patio if we know they are coming in but we had no way of knowing these items were coming in. So what were the times of the other items that were delivered on XXXX XXXX XXXX I have not been provided information on that so I can not make a statement on the other items!!! 
The next item ( Page 18 ) I would like to discuss is the location of my wife on the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX. This document shows that my wife was with her mother in law at address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX. She was there from early morning XXXX till the evening time at which time she returned home and noticed no packages on the porch. I was out fishing at this time. If we know a package is coming to our house we will make an effort to stay home until the package arrives. We did not make arrangements for these packages because we did not order them or know they were being delivered! 
The next item will show that I filed an identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission. Please note for your records. Pages 19-20. 
The next item page 21 will show that the perpetrator tried to attempt to buy the XXXX XXXX DVD player and got declined at XXXX am on the XXXX of XX/XX/2018, he later then was successful on ordering this item on the XXXX I dont know what time because XXXX has withheld this information along which all the other information that is pertinent to this case. 
The next item page 22. This is the first day that I noticed fraud on my B of A account from XXXX. This letter is very generic because on this day my account was re-established because my password did not work to get into my account. This is the first day I contacted XXXX about the fraud.

"XXXX XXXX, 2017 On Thursday morning XXXX XXXX, 2017 I was informed that a fraud check had been deposited to my Chase checking account. I stated that I had not deposited any check, had not given access or permission to anyone to my account. I stated the check was not mine, I had no knowledge of the transaction and that I didnt want anything to do with it and to remove it from my account. 

I was instructed to contact the Fraud Investigation Department of Chase to resolve the matter. I spent several hours on the phone with Chase letting them know I was not involved with any fraud activities. They advised that they were suspending my account. They then instucted me to log on to my account after midnight to reset the password and everything should be fine. I attempeted to do this however was not able to. First thing Friday morning, XXXX XXXX, 2017 I went into the Chase bank to resolve the matter. The Banker was not able to access my account so they called the fraud department for assistance. The advised us that my accounts ( checking, savings and new Visa card ) were all being closed and they could n't do business with me as a customer. They informed me that they would be mailing out a closing check within 7 to 10 days. No further explaination was given. 

I have filed a complaint with Consumer Federal Protection Bureau as I believe I have been treated unfaily and unjust. 
I did not have anything to do with what happened to the Chase account. It had been "" hacked '' and Chase Bank is treating me as the criminal rather than the victim that I am. They have suspended all access to my accounts leaving me without access to my funds until they release them to me.

"To Whom this May Concern- I had my federal student loans previously with XXXX and I consolidated with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX with payment of {$380.00} I was paying my student loan on time and was current with Nelnet up until XX/XX/XXXX. My family had some financial hardship and I had to make a decision to place my student loan on a forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then saw on XXXX some news, regarding school loan servicers, Nelnet and XXXX, in hot water with multiple complaints with consumers. On the article they had a number for a third party that stated it could help lower your payments. 

I called and it sounded like a great idea. I only had to make 5 monthly payments of {$230.00} and then my new payment would be an estimated {$90.00} for 20 years and then the rest of my loan would be forgiven. I did sign the contract and then cancelled immediately because I felt as if it was too good to be true. 

I called to verify my cancellation and also spoke with a manager that confirmed I was on approved for the Pay as You Earn plan. Basically pay the 5 monthly payments of {$230.00} and then 20 years of $ 90 monthly payments and then the rest of my loan was forgiven. She assured me that this program was offered on StudentLoans.gov. 

Below is the verbiage from the third party welcome letter. 

XXXX, It was a pleasure speaking with you, and thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me regarding your Student loan options. 
We provide assistance to borrowers with federal student loans by helping you navigate the myriad of available programs designed to provide financial assistance. We will guide you through the steps necessary to apply and qualify for your benefits with the U.S. Department of Education. We are dedicated to helping people take advantage of U.S. Department of Education approved Direct Consolidation Loan programs. With these programs some of the benefits include : one lender, one payment, fixed rate, a lower payment and/or possible loan forgiveness. I would be happy to assist you in our prescreening process to determine your eligibility for loan forgiveness & consolidation programs.

For general information, you may view our website at XXXX XXXX XXXX/ For specifics please call me on my direct number ( XXXX ) XXXXXXXX. There is no cost or obligation to determine whether any of these U.S. Department of Education sponsored programs can benefit you. 

Listed below are many helpful links about receiving student loan benefits : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : REVIEWS & COMPLAINTS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NELNET XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | Senior Loan Advisor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Office : XXXX | Fax : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The information contained in this electronic transmission, and any attachments, may contain CONFIDENTIAL information. The information is intended only for use by the addressee named above. Any unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination or copying of the contents of the information and any attachments contained in this electronic transmission is strictly prohibited. If you are not the intended addressee, please notify the sender immediately and delete this message. 

I did reach out to the customer service of the Department of Education and they did take down my complaint regarding the third party agreement that was offered. I was told I could just apply on studentloans.gov in order to try to get a lower payment. 

I did go on and apply on studentloans.gov around the end of last month, XXXX. 

I reached out to Nelnet via messenger today and asked for an update regarding my application. This was her response : "" The plan has been processed and your monthly payment is {$500.00} and is effective XX/XX/XXXX. '' "" You are on the revised Pay As you Earn Repayment Plan. Signing the application and submitting it is requesting to have the payment recalculated ''. You're interest rate is 6.25 % ''. 

My previous interest rate was 6.13 %. 

According to my account information on Nelnet 's website, my payment for the first year will be {$500.00} and then for the rest of the term it will be {$700.00}. 

The customer service rep did not mention this jump in payment. 

This is not lower than my current payment. I understand that interest accrues till when you put your loan in a forbearance. So, I thought that was why, but I asked her and her response was the following : "" No, as only {$110.00} of interest was from the forbearance. '' "" The payment plan is based on the income and family size. '' I am beyond frustrated at this point. Why would I want to agree to a higher payment if I was trying to get a lower payment?? It makes no sense that I was not able to agree or decline to the higher payment. 

I would think if a person were applying to an income based repayment plan for the goal of lowering my payment, how increasing my rate and payment makes any sense. 

I told the lady from Nelnet that I would be contacting the CFPB and she immediately said she could try to qualify me for 2 other options. 

One option was to lower my payment to {$430.00} and extend my term to 25 years. It is called the E

xtended Standard Repayment Plan.

The second option was called the Extended Graduated Repayment Plan, the payment starts out at {$330.00}, then {$350.00}, then {$370.00}. the payment increases 15 % every two years for 25 years. At the end of the term my payment would be {$640.00}. 

I wanted to file a complaint because I think this process is very unfair and almost abusive to the consumer. 

Not allowing me to review the new terms and agree or disagree is not okay. 

I feel that including a spouse 's income because we filed jointly and then he or she is not responsible for the loan at any point, makes absolutely no sense. 

If my husband left the picture, I would have to pay this loan myself. Obviously, it would be life change so then I would have to re-apply would probably get a lower payment. 

If something happens to me, such as death, the loan goes away. He isn't held responsible so his income should not be used, in my opinion. 

I also don't appreciate that I can't get a lower payment to what fits my income but people who don't make any money and live off the government ( which also comes out of my checks every month ) can go to school for free. 

I should have had XXXX kids right out of high school and been a single mom so I could have went to school for free. 

This whole process is backwards. I worked very hard for my degree and I will basically be struggling though life financially because I am not qualified for a lower payment to fit my needs. I have XXXX kids and work a full time job. I have a mortgage, car payments, utilities, diaper and formula bills ( no state assistance ), grocery bills, etc. I am not asking for a free ride, I'm asking for some assistance. 

I am asking that someone really re-evaluates the approval process or create a program for individuals who need a plan for that fits their specific needs. My husband does not have any school loans. He was in the military for 8 years. 

Below is my exactly how much I am actually paying towards this loan and all the interest Nelnet is collecting.

It 's fraud, so I should n't be liable. I ca n't even get a secured card because of this nonsense. 

I can pay all my other remarks tonight, that 's not even a big deal because they 're completely legitimate, but that fraudulant address and those debts have to go, because that was n't me. Also, there were a couple hard pulls I do n't recall, as well as emails I got from XXXX and other legitimate banks discusssing loans and paperwork. I would always write back that I have n't taken out any loans and if someone is trying to its fraud, but now I do n't know if any went through for whoever is doing this, and they just are n't on my report yet.

I answered no to all because I never have had a credit card, and have never owned a car because I do not even have a license, let alone insurance. No vehicles should be registered in my name, let alone autoloans.

"I am writing to dispute an incorrect Late Payment mark on my credit. I have been a customer of XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX and have had a good payment history up until XXXX of this year. I advised Exeter that there was a fire in the home above mine which spread to our home and ruined all of our belongings. As a result, my wife and our XXXX kids had to switch homes unexpectedly and due to the expenses, could not make our payment. 

I asked Exeter in XXXX if they could grant me an extension for 2 months so that I could make my next paymentXX/XX/XXXX. We started the extension process but I was told multiple times that they never received my e-mail and the extension never got fully approved until XX/XX/XXXX. At that point, the extension was granted to cover the payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXmaking my next payment due XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I also made a payment to Exeter  in the amount of {$570.00} to cover my XX/XX/XXXX 's payment. OnXX/XX/XXXX, after the Extension was approved my Exeter marked my credit 30 days late for the month of XXXX even though that is the month included in the approved extension. It is clear that this is an error on Exeter 's part however they have not resolved this issue since I brought it to their attention originally. 

Timeline of events :XX/XX/XXXX - first initial call to exeter requesting extension XX/XX/XXXX -  extension documents sent XX/XX/XXXX - I sent extension documents back to XXXX department XX/XX/XXXX - I called exeter back because I had not received any confirmation of the extension being finalized and was told to send in the paperwork again. 
XX/XX/XXXX- called back again regarding extension paperwork and was told the initial request had expired and that I had to refile XX/XX/XXXX - I called back in to check on status of extension request and they advised again they had never received it and sent me a new document XX/XX/XXXX - I sent the document back via e-mail to the XXXX departmentXX/XX/XXXX - I called back to ask about extension request and was advised it was never received. I made a payment which I was told covered the month of XXXX. I was sent new E-sign documents to cover an extension for XXXX and XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I sent E-sign documents back XX/XX/XXXX - the extension was finalized and placed on my account to cover the months of XXXX and XXXX with next due date ofXX/XX/XXXX. 


Again, Exeter reported I was 30 days late to my credit onXX/XX/XXXX which is incorrect because I did have an extension in place. After all we have been through, we are now trying to apply for a house and this has severely affected my credit. I have dropped 120 points due to this mark from Exeter and I did everything in my power throughout these last 2 months to ensure that I had an extension filed and was in good relation with Exeter as a company. It was Exeter that failed to ensure the extension was placed in a timely manner and as a result, they incorrectly marked my account as delinquent 4 days after the actual extension was approved. 

It is of utmost importance that this late mark be removed to help my family qualify for a home and also to have accurate reporting according to the extension that I was approved for on several occasions.",Credit reporting

"This is in reference to CFPB Complaint # XXXX I received a response from American Express that did not answer my questions and concerns. 

1. Even though I am responsible for all the charges on my closed corporate account - it was closed in XX/XX/XXXX, American Express failed to send me any outstanding bills to my email or to my address after XX/XX/XXXX. In response to my last CFPB complaint against American Express ( XX/XX/XXXX - see referenced CFPB complaint ID ), they provided me with all of the bills from XX/XX/XXXX and forward. I can say with 100 % certainty that these bills never arrived at my home and I was never notified appropriately via email. Needless to say, I had to find out the hard way in XX/XX/XXXX that I incurred over {$200.00} in fees. 

If I would've been properly received a bill with the first late fee, I would've paid off the balance in full avoiding this entire situation. I was making payments over the course of the year against the {$320.00} ( which was part of the {$1300.00} charge ). American Express was disputing the entire charge as part of a long term claim that in an effort to have the moving company make the {$320.00} adjustment ). I made several calls to American Express about the issue, however, in order to receive my belongings from the movers that were moving me across country, I was forced to sign on the invoice authorizing the AMEX transaction or they would not hand over my items. The moving company used that to their advantage to show that the transaction was legitimate, even though they were honestly taking advantage of me. I told AMEX that I made several attempts to negotiate and file a claim with the movers but they were uncooperative. 

If I would've received a bill to my address on the statement after XX/XX/XXXX, noting any late fees incurred, I would've paid off the disputed amount in full a long time ago. Also I wasn't notified as to when the disputed charges of {$320.00} were to be paid back to American Express in full by the specified date on the statements provided to me in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Instead of handling this appropriately by reaching out to me via email or mail with a statement, American Express decided to send me to collections over a year and a half later over these late fees I never knew about. American Express told me in their response to my last CFPB complaint, that my corporate card agreement stipulates the late fees, however, I was not notified until now ( after being sent to collections ). 

I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX asking them why I wasn't notified about this outstanding balance/payments and they told me that I needed to handle this directly with American Express and not them. How am I to know of what I owe if no one proactively took the effort to reach out to me with a statement or email notification between XX/XX/XXXX to current? 

The balance was paid back in full after the collections agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) inappropriately handled my account - a CFPB complaint was filed against them for this issue as well and for the violation of my privacy rights. - 2. Issue regarding the disclosure of my privacy information : Your response to my initial complaint doesn't suffice. Nowhere in the cardholder agreement does it explicitly say that you can disclose my sensitive personal banking information ( my checking account and routing numbers ) to a third party collections agency - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After my CFPB Complaint to them, they confirmed that American Express ( their client )  transferred over my sensitive bank account and routing number information to them in a confidential manner. Being that this is my sensitive personal data, American Express had to notify me before doing such transfer of personal data.

"To Whom It May Concern ; I am writing you to lodge a formal complaint against LVNV Funding LLC . Over the past year I have spoken to several lawyers and members from XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) who pointed out several issues that appear on my credit report. To date, LVNV Funding has reported derogatory remarks with all three credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) without proper notification. 
Please note the following case : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Case No. XXXX ( XXXX ) UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, DISTRICT OF MINNESOTAConsistent with the views of the FTC -- and consistent with the views expressed in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX -- the XXXX finds that XXXX was engaged in "" collection of the debt '' in violation of XXXX ( when it reported XXXX 's disputed debt to the CRAs before sending verification of that debt to XXXX. The Court therefore agrees with Judge XXXX that XXXX is entitled to summary judgment as to liability on his FDCPA claim. 

No debt collector is required to report a debt to a CRA before verifying that debt to a consumer -- and thus, as the Court held above, it is reasonable to view such a practice as a species of debt collection prohibited under XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX 's XXXX-based employees violated the FDCPA when they reported that debt to the CRAs before first verifying the debt to XXXX. 

XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) ; see also XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) This case specifies that the consumer must have the debt verified by dunning letter or communication prior to reporting to the credit reporting agencies. I was never notified via dunning letter or any other form of communication by LVNV Funding of any debt. Therefor LVNV is in violation of the above statue. Furthermore, I would like for your agency investigate the following circumstances into the account in this matter:1. LVNV Funding is listed on XXXX as a Factoring Company, when per FCRA collection companies are not. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, a XX/XX/XXXX decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the XXXX XXXX which re-characterized a factoring transaction as a secured borrowing rather than a "" true sale '' of accounts. 

In the XXXX case the court stated "" the so-called factoring agreement is the functional equivalent of a secured lending agreement. '' Whether the agreement is a secured loan or a true purchase of receivables turns on whether there was an actual transfer of the risk of loss. A transfer of risk occurs when the account seller 's debt is extinguished, and the account purchaser 's "" risk with regard to the performance of the accounts is direct. '' The court in XXXX explained that the parties had "" confected '' a secured loan or revolving line of credit, rather than a true sale of assets, through a percentage advance subject to the lender maintaining a reserve in any amount the lender deemed appropriate. 

2. LVNV Funding is adding on varying fees to the balances on each report per month sometimes {$3.00}, sometimes {$11.00}, sometimes $ XXXX the past 6.5 years. There is no basis for these add on fees or was I given any detail on these so called interest charges.

"I recently learned that a fraudulent account in the amount of {$500.00} was opened in my name via Speed Cash 's online process. 

Speedy Cash seems to have no issues providing cash to a fraudulently opened accounts but when it comes to answer question posed by fraud victims they and their compliance staff can not be located or wo n't answer. 

Speedy Cash 's business model, which loosely verifies identities via its online application process is an inherent danger to the general public. Their processes puts the onus on the fraud victim to show that the account opened was not theirs. Why should the general public have to spend their time getting police reports to satisfy the fact that the company has inappropriate policies and procedures to protect the public from fraudulent accounts? 

I have tried to contact the Firm 's compliance officer, chief compliance officer and public relations officer and apparently they are not willing to discuss their process with consumers and have failed to return my email. Further, I have requested to speak directly with their compliance officer but was told by customer service that their compliance officer does n't speak to consumers. As a compliance officer myself, in a different industry, I never hesitate to pick up the phone and explain policies and procedures and in general educate consumers whenever possible. Clearly their Firm 's view on compliance is narrow and in effective. 

Please take a look at this firm and ensure their policies and procedures develop significant safeguard to protect the general public from accounts fraudulently created in their name.",Debt collection

"My name is XXXX XXXX. I am a XXXX veteran that used my VA loan guaranteed to buy a house. I used wells Fargo for my loan. There were many mistakes made by wells Fargo regarding my loan and violations of the Truth In Lending Act and RESPA. I have filed 2 complaints to the CFPB. Congressman XXXX filed a complaint in my name. The Federal Reserve filed a complaint in my name, and the white house filed a complaint in my name. Those complaint numbers will be on the bottom of this response to Wells Fargos response that was sent. Multiple points on wells Fargos reports contain false information designed to conceal and fraud me and the CFPB and all associated persons or agencies. I will be addressing those concerns in this new complaint. I also ask that my issues be escalated to investigation by someone besides wells Fargo based on the facts contained in this response. 
Regarding Wind insurance required by Wells Fargo. In both reports by Wells Fargos Executive Resolution Specialists XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX admitted that wells Fargo was at fault for failure to disclose insurance requirements before the loan could close. XXXX stated in his report that the requirement for wind insurance was cleared incorrectly. On a phone call between myself and XXXX in which we both recorded XXXX says that they accidently clicked off the box requiring wind insurance. In the report provided by XXXX she mentions that it was their mistaken belief that wind insurance coverage was included in the homeowners insurance policy. This is a blatant lie as verification of home owners insurance states there is no wind insurance coverage. That means they had knowledge prior to closing that there was no wind insurance coverage, but they continued without regard to the customer. The reason I believe that if they disclosed wind insurance before and if they would have provided an estimate that my DTI ratio would have been over 50 % as it is now. 
Regarding forged documents there were multiple copies of my uniform residential loan application. Wells Fargo is using an out dated superseded document to determine my Debt to Income Ratio.  They have admitted and provided proof that they are using values off of a document dated XX/XX/XXXX. The values on the same form dated XX/XX/XXXX signed in person in front of a notary was the last URLA to be used and supersedes any previous URLA with an earlier date. It is not legal to use superseded paperwork as the current version when they provided both forms that were dated. Furthermore they knowingly continue to use the incorrect values as stated on that superseded document knowing that the form has been superseded by another. 
Regarding the DTI calculations. The values that were used to calculate my DTI ratio that were used in Wells Fargos report were falsely taken from an application dated XX/XX/XXXX when that application was superseded by another on XX/XX/XXXX and should never have been used. My legal liability values taken from the last signed application and before the undisclosed wind insurance were XXXX which equals to 43.32 %. When the missing wind insurance was added after closing the percent comes to 51.23 % in XX/XX/XXXX. Since wind insurance in my area has increased 19.23 % in XX/XX/XXXX the new and current DTI ration is 52.75. Wells Fargo has stated in their reports that a DTI of below 41 % is acceptable. The CFPB has laws and regulations that they follow to include stating that below 43 % DTI ratio is acceptable for lending. My DTI ratio was 43.32 % before the wind insurance was added and over 51 % after it was added after closing. This shows my loan and DTI where never acceptable for lending by both Wells Fargos standards and CFPB laws and regulations. The only reason my loan went through with this regard is that Wells Fargo knowingly used out dated superseded paperwork to commit fraud. 
Regarding the Appraisal report. When using a VA loan the appraiser must be a VA appraiser. Part of being a VA appraiser is knowing all VA policys regarding appraisal. They are required to make sure all Minimum Property Requirements are met. This included structural integrity of the house. The appraiser that was utilized marked no and adds upon the initial evaluation there were no adverse conditions noted that would affect the integrity of the property. This is false as a VA representative that came to my home and did a second report on my home because I filed a complaint. This person from the VA told me how to fix the structure damage myself and that if I have a company fix it. It would be very expensive and try to fix it myself. The appraiser knowingly lied about the damage and can be proven by the appraisal report. It shows pictures taken of the structural damage to the home in multiple pictures. The MPRs  were not satisfied in this report as they should have been resulting in my loan being approved when it should not have been.

"( I have dates later on/for recent events but as issues started in XXXX, I am really unsure of the start dates. ) As I can show through documents, they have been reporting I 'm paying XXXX $ on my Navient Account History private loan/Tuition Answer statement. However, in my bank statements from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( and for who knows how long prior -- I 'm working on getting those statements ), they 've been taking XXXX $ out. The bank shows the XXXX taken out on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and Navient shows the XXXX $ taken out/posted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Also, the amount going towards principal varies in ways that do n't make sense. I realize that the amount can changed based on how much is owed. However, in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX of the XXXX went to principal ; XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX towards principal of the XXXX ; XXXX/XXXX/XXXX an unknown adjustment of XXXX cents added to principal balance ; XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX paid to principal of the XXXX payment ; XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX paid to principal of XXXX ; XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX towards principal of XXXX payment ; XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX to principal of XXXX. Should n't the amount going to principal go up or at least remain consistent if the loan is n't going up and payments are posting on the same days each month?

( I also can not log in as myself -- it says I am disabled from it but my husband ( co-signer ) can log in. This tends to be a running theme. ) This is particularly true because prior to entering into the for-profit world, I found them difficult in terms of repayment options. This student loan is a private one that I took out while waiting for federal options to become available. The loan is significantly higher than when I started. I had a lot of trouble getting the payments lowered and was instructed more than once that my only option was pay the full payment amount at a high interest rate or forebearance. At one point, I was told the only way to get my interest rate lowered was to stop making payments ( to get a program that would be much like a mortgage relief loan but turned out to be a reduced interest program whose structure I still do not understand. ) The forebearance 's caused unpaid interest to capitalize ; which I was made aware of. Anyway, in XXXX I left non-profit and started making full payments. Now, I am finding that I am still not consistently paying on the principal and that they are taking out more than what they are showing as applied. I am working on going back to XXXX to see if they were taking out more than is reporting on the Navient website/account history for longer than the last 2 months.

"XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington, XXXX XXXX Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Fax : ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Regarding : American Express and Violations of Fair Credit and Reporting Act Dear XXXX XXXX : I am writing to file a complaint against American Express XXXX. As both a business owner and a head of household, I have maintained dozens of credit cards during the last 30 years, and I have never had to complain about the service I was getting from a credit card company. Unfortunately, the credit card and charge card companies have suddenly changed their operational policies, attacking customers and flouting the Fair Credit and Reporting Act. A review of my accounts will show that I have always paid my credit card bills in full and on time each month, and in the rare instances where credit card payments have been a few days late, this occurred because of problems with the mail, when I was traveling, or under circumstances beyond my control. I am writing at this time to file a complaint against American Express, having failed to get any response from American Express after sending multiple letters to XXXX XXXX at the corporate office. Despite the fact that I have been a very good, loyal customer for more than twenty years, American Express has engaged in hostile tactics against my account, freezing my account without notice over a {$1.00} charge from XXXX that the fraud department thought might be a fraudulent charge on my account. I am sure you can appreciate that this is far more than an inconvenience. 

I am incredibly disappointed with the recent American Express customer disservice I have experienced this past month. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX, a merchant in XXXX, XXXX, complaining that they had attempted to bill my credit card for services they were providing and American Express had refused to authorize the purchase. Having just arrived home from the hospital after the death of a family member earlier that morning and having spent more than 10 weeks trying to work with the United States XXXX XXXX - which had lost the package for two months - I am sure you can appreciate how upsetting it was when American Expresses refused to authorize this transaction, particularly when I have always paid my American Express bill in-full and on-time. 

Despite being very busy dealing with life and death patient emergencies on Friday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I had to interrupt patient care to call American Express in order to find out what was happening with my business credit card. When I spoke with the customer service supervisor in the fraud department, XXXX told me that American Express had initiated a fraud alert on my account. I did not initiate the fraud alert. To make matters worse, I received absolutely no contact from American Express, whether by telephone, text message, email, or conventional mail, notifying me that there were concerns about fraud on my account. Please listen to the recording of this phone call very carefully. At first, the employee from the fraud department seemed uncertain about which transaction had triggered the alert. XXXX then identified a transaction in the amount of one dollar from XXXX, but he was not able to provide me any further context. Initially, I told him that I did not recognize the transaction off the top of my head and that I would need to do further research. He went through a number of other transactions with me, and not having my credit card statements or receipts, I initially did not recognize some of the transactions but after speaking with my office staff, we were able to confirm that all of the other transactions XXXX described me were legitimate transactions. This became a very time-consuming effort in the middle of busy patient care, and XXXX insisted on going through far more transactions than most fraud representatives would have gone through, particularly when I was identifying all of them as legitimate transactions ( except uncertainty about XXXX ). I explained to XXXX that I had recently experienced fraud on my XXXX  XXXX account as a result of the XXXX security breach, and I specifically and repeatedly asked XXXX to please not take any action against my American Express account and that I would look into the validity of the XXXX charge and get back to American Express as soon as possible. At that point, your employee reiterated that he would not suspend or close the account and that the American Express fraud department would keep an eye on the single XXXX transaction and that American Express would immediately approve and release the funds to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

About two hours later, I had my office manager call back because I received an email from XXXX that reminded me that the charge from the XXXX was legitimate. When we called American Express the second time on Friday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we were told that the security alerts would be taken off the account, that the account was active an unrestricted, and that all of the transactions were being accepted and paid, specifically the charges from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

On the morning of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was incredibly embarrassed when I received another email from the merchant in XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, telling me that American Express had once again refused the transaction. Amazing! My office assistant called American Express and spoke with XXXX and was told that the account had been closed due to fraud. Stunning! Your representatives from Friday did exactly the opposite of what they promised me they would do. When we called back on Friday the second representative gave no indication that the account had been closed, and again American Express has made no effort to contact me or to notify me of a problem with the account or that the account was being closed or restricted. I had just spent last week in transferring many of my XXXX XXXX recurring automatic payments to American Express, and now American Express has caused me and my employees a lot of extra work and has cost my business significant and quantifiable financial losses. I was in the process of transferring most of my regular business back to American Express after the fiasco with Equifax and XXXX XXXX, and now I am dealing with the same type of incompetence at American Express. I can not believe that American Express is holding up my account hostage over a one dollar charge, particularly when the charge was completely legitimate. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we asked to speak with a customer service supervisor, and I finally spoke with XXXX, employee identification number XXXX. XXXX repeatedly addressed me as XXXX XXXX, and most professionals who have attended 25 years of schooling find being addressed by their first name or Mr. extremely insulting. Again, I would encourage you to listen to the tape. I was certainly very upset with the way American Express has treated me. Your employees did exactly the opposite of what we agreed they would do and more importantly what they should have done - and there was no grounds for them to close my account. XXXX claims that my account was closed because I had previously reported fraud and someone taking over my accounts and posing as me. I do not recall this ever happening. While there have been instances of infrequent, minor fraud, I suspect not much different from most accounts doing the volume of business that we are doing. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was in the process of moving a lot of my business back to American Express, about $ XXXX {$50000.00} per month of credit card transactions. This experience has been very just stretching. At XXXX XXXX, I was earning 2 % cash back, and I was not paying an annual fee. At American Express, I am paying a {$490.00} annual fee, and my rewards points are limited to very expensive merchants and these merchants are charging a huge premium on rewards points, or the alternative is The XXXX XXXX which has horrible customer service and low quality products. 

My employees and I have now wasted several hours because of American Express employees mistakes, and this has cost me and my business {$4000.00} in lost revenue, along with loss of use and loss of opportunity. American Express has paralyzed my business for no good reason, taking away my access to credit. I believe this is a violation of the Fair Credit and Reporting Act. Not only did American Express close my account, but American Express failed to notify me in a timely fashion, and American Express failed to send out replacement credit cards. Four days had passed before I discovered - on my own - that there was a problem. Meanwhile, four days also lapsed without replacement cards being sent. This is totally unacceptable service on a platinum credit card for which I am paying {$500.00} a year. I wonder how your Black Card customers are treated! Consequently, I am requesting a full refund of my {$490.00} annual fee along with the credit of XXXX reward points to offset my cost and lost income. Please make sure I have my replacement cards this afternoon. Please have American Express contact XXXX XXXX XXXX to accept responsibility for the failure to authorize payment. 



I have written multiple letters to American Express Chief Executive Officer XXXX XXXX and to the corporate office, and I have either had no response or my concerns have been passed off to a low level, poorly-trained customer service representative with no authority to correct any of the problems we have face.

"Hello, I'm not sure if I answered the correct pro-forma questions because I wasn't sure which of the categories my situation falls into. 

I recently had a collection appear on my credit report from the collection agency Radius Global Solutions. It's for a medical bill. I have no idea what this medical bill could be and have not been contacted by any of my medical providers for an amount similar to what Radius is asking. I had  some labwork done around the time Radius claims my debt was created, but my insurance company shows that the service was paid for in full. Also, I did receive a phone call from a collection agency several months ago about thousands of dollars of medical debt, but given that, to my knowledge, I had no outstanding bills I assumed it was a scam.

I can't get any additional information from Radius Global Solutions because they literally never answer their phone, and the voicemail is full. I have been trying for weeks to contact them about this mystery debt but every time I call the main line they tell me it's the wrong number and they give me the correct number. When I call the correct number it rings for hours and eventually gives me the option to leave a voicemail ; however, the voicemail box is full and so I can't leave a voicemail. So, when I try to contact their "" quality assurance line '' I also don't get an answer and so I leave a voicemail ; however, after two weeks and several voicemails, I still haven't gotten a call back. On the last couple of voicemails I told them that if they didn't call back I would file a complaint with CFPB or FTC. 

This is affecting my credit significantly, I never received any mail or phone calls from any original provider notifying me of any debt, and the collection agency has yet to explain exactly where this mystery debt came from.

In XX/XX/XXXX the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered GE Capital Retail Bank and its subsidiary, CareCredit, to refund up to {$34.00} million to potentially more than 1 million consumers who were victims of this deceptive credit card enrollment tactic. The cards actually accrued interest that kicked in if the full balance was not paid at the end of a promotional period. Under this no interest if paid in full plan, consumers make monthly payments while CareCredit assesses 26.99 percent annual interest on a consumers balance throughout a promotional period, which can range from six to 24 months. If any portion of the balance has not been paid when the promotional period ends, the consumer becomes liable for all of the accrued interest.

"This complaint is about discriminatory practices and denial of services by MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL, INC.. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , Texas On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I initiated a money transfer on MoneyGram site. 
This was a {$1900.00} transfer to my cousin in XXXX. The fee, using my bank account was {$5.00}. The transaction authorization number is XXXX, obtained using my online account and password, and a security code sent to my email. 
At XXXX, an email was sent asking to call MoneyGram ( XXXX ). 
Which I did. After verifications ( name, address, date of birth, last XXXX of SSN ... ), the agent asked my relationship to the transfer 's beneficiary .I told her it was not their business, but nonetheless answered. 
She then asked the transfer 's purpose. I questioned the purpose of this question. She decided that the transaction was cancelled and that I should go to a store. 
I asked to speak to a manager on that discriminatory practice, because it was not applied to all users of MoneyGram but selectively based on destination ( XXXX ), sender perceived or implied origin, or both. 
After narrating the facts as above, the escalation person told me that I was asked these questions because t it was my first transaction ( after telling me it was asked from all ). 
I responded I had used the MoneyGram online to send money to XXXX during the previous 30 days. As a matter of fact, records available show I did a transfer to XXXX using the very same service on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( ref XXXX ), to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( ref XXXX ) ( see attached confirmation emails ). 
In fact I have been using MoneyGram transfer service way back with some archived records showing transfer dating back to XXXX with amount as large if not larger ( see attached receipt emails ) with online account established as early as XXXX/XXXX/XXXX if not earlier. 
I indicated to the representative that MoneyGram 's practice was discriminatory as I was NOT asked these questions when transferring money to XXXX, but asked when transferring to XXXX, a XXXX XXXX country. 
She pretended it was for the protection of my account and I asked how the statement about the reason of my transfer which they have no way of verifying, is protecting my account. 
The conversation ended as the representative indicated again that my transaction has been cancelled ( not offering me the opportunity to answer the transfer purpose question ) and I should go to a store to complete the transaction. 
It should be noted that transaction at the store and the online transactions carry different fees. Using the online transaction and a funding from a previously associated bank account -as I did-, the transaction fee is {$5.00}, with a delivery in few days. That option and fee is NOT available in stores and the fee for the same transfer in a store is {$39.00}. This is a significant XXXX fee increase. 
The online transaction I initiated does not present any risk profile by any reasonable standard, with the funding is from a bank account in my name and is therefore fully traceable and all security checks listed above. 
As I tried to login into my account later in the early evening and was directed to contact Customer Service again. 
On the call, the representative told me that my account was permanently closed and service was denied by Security, that no reason shall be provided, and that I had to go in stores. 
This is an unacceptable denial of service on a discriminatory basis. 
My wife -XXXX-did endure the same discriminatory practice but did not complain. 
I would request the agency investigates and take action to prevent the repetition of such discriminatory practices. 
I am requesting that my online account -XXXX- and that of my wife XXXX- be fully re-instated with all transfer privileges according to the fee and rules applicable to all.

I asked them numerous times to contact XXXX to verify what I was telling them. They took XXXX 's info. but according to XXXX, did n't contact them. XXXX said they had consistent problems when dealing with Honda Financial and this was n't anything new. I ca n't tell you how many times we tried to contact Honda Financial.

Honda was determined to mark our credit 30 days late ( a mark WE NEVER HAD in 5 years of financing the vehicle! ) I think possibly they wanted to continue to charge interest? Finally after many days of going back and forth XXXX was able to payoff the entire loan. But not until more interest accrued and our credit was marked 30 days late!

Moreover, I called them yesterday and both a local rep and a national rep said that all they see in their system are two RECENT inquiries attached to FLORIDA locations, of which I also have absolutely no clue about.

It was a very stressful process because it was explained multiple times that another department might have gotten the information -- it seemed one department did n't know what the other one was doing. I would always respond with whatever information was requested. 
In XXXX XXXX, we were put on a trial program and we paid each and every payment on time and in full. I have documentation of all the check numbers that were given, amounts and when they were given. However, in the spring of XXXX, I was told we had been denied the Loan modification! I did n't understand because I had sent in all documents and performed as requested, but the representative assured me the appeal would be accepted if I just kept making the payments on time, so I continued making payments. 
Both my husband and I were employed and in XXXX XXXX, I called to finalize our Loan Modification. The lender requested our pay stubs and asked that we write another Hardship letter ( which we did ), and meet with a credit counselor, which we did in XXXX XXXX. We felt we were getting very close to finalizing our Loan Modification. But, we received no paperwork from the lender, and when we called, no one seemed to know anything, and just advised us to continue to pay our trial payment, which we did. 
By XXXX XXXX, the company I was working for had to downsize and laid-off many of the sales staff, including me. I went on unemployment. At this time, however, XXXX was working more and XXXX, our loan contact, stated that all she needed was XXXX more paystubs, which we provided. We faxed his pay stubs as requested, and a letter from XXXX 's employer. In addition, we faxed my unemployment information. I never heard from XXXX again. 
In XXXX XXXX, I was told we had been denied our modification and that we would have to reapply. In addition, you sent back part of our trial payment for that month, and said the lender could not accept these payments anymore. 
At this time SLS became involved in the situation. When I gave our information to reapply, I was told that the lender could take only one source of income per phone call and, therefore, we did not qualify for Making Home Affordable. It was crazy-making and completely ridiculous that we could not give you ALL of our financial information at one time so we would qualify. 
In XXXX, we decided to go to an attorney to follow-up on our Trial Loan Modification payments. We were told that none of the trial payments went to the principle of our loan. In other words, none of the 16 months of payments, at $ XXXX ( almost {$34000.00} ), were applied to our mortgage.

"I have been a customer of Navy Federal Credit Union, NFCU, since XXXX. My household have used array of their products and we were happy with our experience until XX/XX/XXXX. That day I discovered ( after logging into the credit card account ) that our account was past due by two payments. I have kept my account on automatic payment since opening the card a few years ago. 
I contacted NFCU and was transferred to the collections department. The representative with collections stated if I paid the two late payments ( making the account current ) he could backdate the payments to make the payments register as on-time payments allowing the card to stay open, keeping the current interest rate and points, cancelling the late fees, and all features of the card to remain in effect as per the original card agreement. I setup the payment which cleared from my checking account. I was very thankful NFCU could make this arrangement to backdate my payment allowing the card and service to remain open and active. 
Unfortunately, after to speaking to a representative later in XX/XX/XXXX I was told the account was closed and could not be reopened. I explained the situation to several representatives and ( after several calls ) Credit Card Solutions Supervisor was finally assigned to review my case. I was instructed to write a letter to NFCU to request the account to be re-opened. On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a letter to NFCU to re-open the account. During a call to them in or around XX/XX/XXXX they confirmed they received the letter and are reviewing the case. 
XXXX was the NFCU CC Resolutions Supervisor reviewing my case and I requested she listen to the call with Collections, because she stated I had requested an extension. I didn't know what that was and had to have her explain an extension to me. I indicated I never asked for or received an extension. Anyway, XXXX stated collections can only listen to the call and she would have a Collections supervisor listen to the call and that person would contact me. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and left a message with XXXX indicating she could contact me the following day. I still have not received a call back from XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX, Collections Supervisor, who stated the collections representative did not make it clear I was receiving an extension, which is downplaying the conversation. I made it clear that extension or conversation around extension did not happen and further explained 3 times or more what the representative told me about making the double payments and keeping the card open, etc. At no point did XXXX dispute what I was telling him. He only stated it had been a while since he listened to the call. He stated he doesn't make the decision to re-open the account and that he would speak to XXXX who is handling the case. 
Since two months have passed without any written reply from NFCU about my letter to re-open my account I contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX. I was on the phone for two hours with 5 different representatives in 3 different departments until lastly speaking to another collections supervisor ( after trying to speak to XXXX who was "" away from her desk '' and XXXX who was "" away from his desk ''. The collections supervisor was of no help and transferred me to XXXX 's Supervisors ' voicemail, XXXX. I left XXXX a detailed message. The real kicker of that call is that the representative stated that my file investigation to re-open the account closed on XX/XX/XXXX ... again, no I received no phone call XXXX or missed calls/ voicemails ), email, or letter. Another kicker, I am paying {$200.00} in interest every month out of a total $ XXXX  payment that I pay on time. 
Last night, while filing taxes, I stumbled upon a NFCU letter dated XX/XX/XXXX : RE : Credit Card Extension Agreement Dear XXXX : Pursuant to your request for an extension on the above-referenced loan account, as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, your monthly credit card payment due date has been extended. This letter confirms our prior telephone conversation, in which you agreed to an extension on your credit card account. 

As part of the extension agreement, your account is current, and your payment due date has been extended. This extension agreement will give you additional time to repay your credit card account. As of the date of this letter, the next payment due date for your account is XX/XX/XXXX and the outstanding loan balance on the account is $ XXXX. You monthly minimum payment amount is 2 %, or $ XXXX, whichever is greater. 

Additionally, you understand that finance charges will continue to accrue on the outstanding loan balance during the extension period. All other terms and conditions of the original Credit Card XXXXement and Disclosure are unchanged and remain in full force and effect.

"After graduating college in 2002 I began to repay my student loans. I had approximately {$17000.00} in Federal subsidized loans. After struggling to repay them, XXXX XXXX reached out to me to consolidate my loans into a lower, monthly payment. I agreed to consolidate my Federal subsidized loans with XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately, I ( nor my mother, who was helping me make this decision ) did not fully understand what I was agreeing to, nor was XXXX XXXX forthcoming in disclosing that the lower payment would be interest only. Not until the interest only period was up, and I received a notification that my payment was increasing to include a small portion of my principle, did my spouse and I inquire about the terms of my loan. I contacted XXXX XXXX to ask for a copy of the loan terms and promissory note. After several more requests for this information, XXXX XXXX finally agreed to send me a copy. The promissory note did not have a physical signature on it and the note itself, was very vague pertaining to the loan terms. 
Clearly the terms were not fully disclosed to me because shortly after I consolidated the loan, I went back to school ( which was my plan at the time of the consolidation ) and made interest only payments during that time. However, if I had left them as Federal subsidized loans, I could have deferred them while I went back to school and not paid any interest. 
After reviewing the loan with my spouse, I reached out to XXXX XXXX to attempt a mutually beneficial resolution because I felt mislead and uninformed. XXXX XXXX refused.

On at least one occasion I have disputed the validity of the information being reported for this account and the dispute always comes back as unchanged and the account information being reported has been verified.
The issue was clarified in the XX/XX/XXXX amendments to the FCRA, which set a specific starting date that is now SET BY LAW as the last deliqency date, and not later dates, such as a DOLP.
FCRA Section 605 : ( c ) Running of reporting period.
( 1 ) In general. The 7-year period referred to in paragraphs ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) ** of subsection ( a ) shall begin, with respect to any delinquent account that is placed for collection ( internally or by referral to a third party, whichever is earlier ), charged to profit and loss, or subjected to any similar action, upon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the commencement of the delinquency which immediately preceded the collection activity, charge to profit and loss, or similar action.
Late Payments - Seven years from the month in which the late payment was due. If there are multiple late 
payments in one account item, then they will each expire individually.
Charge-Offs - Seven years. The time runs from the date of the delinquency, plus 180 days. For example, if a payment was due on an account on XX/XX/XXXX, but the debtor defaulted, and never caught up to become current again, and the account is eventually declared a charge-off by the creditor, then the seven years reporting time limit starts running on XX/XX/XXXX, with the item scheduled to expire from his/her credit reports on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached paperwork directly from the XXXX website that clearly shows the first late on thisaccount occurred on/around XX/XX/XXXX, but my credit files are reporting that there was n't a late on the account until XX/XX/XXXX. This erroneous entry showing an incorrect date of first delinquency is detrimental to my overall credit rating and has caused me severe financial and emotional distress. My question now is how was this investigation conducted to confirm that what is currently being reported is accurate? A template response to my complaint at this point will not be acceptable. This account is not only being in-accurately reported but is also past the reporting limits based on the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

"I filed a complaint ( # XXXX ) against HSBC for unlawfully - and without my knowledge, permission, or consent - revoking an ACH mortgage payment agreement I have had for 14 years. Only I can revoke it and I have not. HSBC 's money is in the bank and it is HSBC 's own fault not to use the ACH agreement to collect the funds. 

I just received via CFPB a response letter from HSBC. It makes no reference to the said complaint number, nor does it address ANY of complaints. HSBC must do so, sooner or later.

In its letter, HSBC states "" As you know, on XX/XX/XXXX, you were offered a modification trial plan. Your account was set up to automatically debit ( direct debit ) your monthly mortgage payment. However, since trial plan payments can not be drafted via direct debit, we cancelled your direct debit and subsequently notified you via letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ...

"We have desperately been trying to get Home Point Financial to resolve this problem before our real estate taxes are due! Believing that our XX/XX/ mortgage payment had been lost in the mail ( it had not cleared bank ), we called Home Point Financial on XX/XX/XXXX and asked if they had received our check to which they replied that "" no, they had not received it ''. We then made a duplicate electronic payment through our bank. The very next day, the original check cleared resulting in a duplicate payment. We contacted Home Point and they said that if we faxed them a copy of our banking activity which showed that both the check and electronic payment had cleared, they would reimburse us for the double payment in 5 business days. We faxed the bank proof on XX/XX/XXXX. Home Point did not issue a check to reimburse for the double payment as promised. Instead, they applied the additional escrow portion of the double payment to our escrow balance ( increasing escrow balance ) and applied the additional principle amount to our principle balance ( reducing the principle amount to be paid off ). Where the interest portion, {$610.00}, of this duplicate XX/XX/ payment went is a mystery to me. Home Point claims it went to the payoff which is ridiculous since they were only owed 2 days of per diem due to our refinancing of the loan with a new lender onXX/XX/XXXX. ( We refinanced the loan with a new lender on XX/XX/XXXX and Home Point was wired payoff funds onXX/XX/XXXX ). The amount of the payoff funds that they received was {$190000.00} although the remaining principle balance was only {$190000.00}. The difference after applying the release fee of {$57.00} and 2 days (XX/XX/XXXX settlement ) of per diem of {$20.00} x 2 days is {$470.00} which was also owed to us by Home Point. We filed two separate complaints prior to this one, and as a result have finally received our escrow balance, and a refund of the overpayment of our payoff. However, we have not received a refund of the interest portion of the XX/XX/2018 duplicate payment ( approx. {$610.00} ) Home Point claimed in their response to complaint no. XXXX that the payoff statement from ourXX/XX/XXXX refinance was reduced by this interest amount, but that is a false statement. They were paid in full plus some on XX/XX/XXXX and the only interest they are entitled to for XX/XX/2018 is {$40.00} ( already figured in the payoff ). {$610.00} represents a full month of interest for XXXX which Home Point Financial is not entitled to! 

In summary, we were owed {$3500.00} for Escrow ; we were owed {$470.00} due to the overpayment of the refinance payoff ; and we were owed {$610.00} which was the interest portion of the duplicate XX/XX/2018 payment. This totals {$4600.00} that was owed to us by Home Point. As a result of our filing 2 complaints, we finally received the following checks from Home Point : Check no. XXXX for {$3700.00} ; check no. XXXX for {$240.00} ; and check no. XXXX for {$130.00}. These checks total {$4100.00}. Therefore, we are still owed {$520.00}.

It amazes me how the fate of my family and our funds rests solely in the hands of one person who might not fully understand the whole situation and the surrounding details on the account. It is my form belief my room mates were using my card information which they obtained from our computers to place online orders, and while I was in the hospital my wallet and phone were left at home by accident and I was hospitalized about an hour away from home so my room mates had access to my card and phone. I am now facing my account being negative over {$5000.00} and being closed on top of that and Wells Fargo will not reconsider, even though I have spoken to Reps and been able to get them to reverse charges that they tried to take back in the first place ; their reason is saying that one of the cards that was used had a chip in it and is impossible to duplicate not understanding that I'm not disputing that the card was not duplicated however I was physically unable to get my personal belongings in order before I was hospitalized and my room mates pretty much robbed me and Wells Fargo is letting them! I just want a fair chance at having the account and information looked over again and I believe whole heartedly the right person will understand this was not my fault.",Bank / Checking / Savings

"Complaint about Carrington Mortgage Foreclosing on FHA loan in Federal Disaster area after owner requests disaster relief for the Hurricanes affecting XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

I recently bought a home on a FHA loan through Carrington Mortgage in XXXX. I was impacted by the hurricanes of XXXX both in my home state of XXXX and where I was working in XXXX XXXX. I was able to shift my work back to XXXX but lost some time at work due to the storms and lost out on potential future revenue from an upcoming business opportunity that aligned with my research that may have yielded future work and XXXX school   opportunities with the XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . 

When I received a letter from Carrington dated XX/XX/XXXX offering assistance due to the hurricanes I called them immediately. I called and spoke to a representative that told me I was in a federal disaster area, and that I could seek deferment for 6 months and at the end of the 6 month period I would pay my normal mortgage and that the unpaid mortgage payments for those 6 months would be added to the end of my loan extending the date to pay it off, and I accepted it. However, the next month I got a mortgage statement ; it showed an overdue balance. I called and spoke to a representative from Carrington who assured me everything was ok, that the paperwork hasnt caught up with the disaster relief and that I didnt need to make a payment. Same thing happened the next month and I called again and got the same assurances. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX, two days after XXXX while visiting my fiancs relatives in XXXX XXXX I get a phone call from Carrington saying they are going to foreclose on my property! I called and after several hours on the phone I reached a verbal agreement for disaster assistance from XXXX at extension XXXX. The terms were I could pay what I could but normal payments would start back on XX/XX/XXXX, I didnt need to pay anything now ; and nothing was mentioned about paying back mortgage payments. I still never received anything in the mail pertaining to the disaster relief, the terms of my relief package, or what my rights were under this agreement. 

I still continued to receive mortgage statements every month that showed I owed a past due amount from XX/XX/XXXX on till XX/XX/XXXX. Every month I would call and get the same response that I was in this disaster relief program ; that I was in a Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Area and a payment wasnt required. At no time was I made aware of the requirement to pay the back mortgage to become current. After contacting Carrington Mortgage again to try and gain insight into my loan I noticed on the website that I could not access to certain parts of my loan and that when I discovered that it was in default. Soon after that I received a notice of intent to foreclose in the regular mail, I never received anything by certified mail and thought it was my normal mortgage statement and didnt open it at first. I called and spoke to someone at Carrington, and though they were apologetic about my current predicament, and were as just as confused as I was as how I ended up here ; were not really willing to offer any way forward other than to submit RMA paperwork. So I submitted the first RMA paperwork on XX/XX/XXXX and received a confirmation that it was to be reviewed. On XX/XX/XXXX I received the Loss Mitigation Evaluation Notice that stated I did not qualify for any assistance and my only option was to liquidate the home. I called and spoke to a representative in the Mortgage department and upon hearing that I left out my fiancs income and a few other assets-he encouraged me to reapply. However, I was not made aware of my rights to appeal any decision nor was I aware that I could have been making payments all along to Carrington. So I reapplied for RMA on XX/XX/XXXX and the package was under review, it was sent back for being incomplete on XX/XX/XXXX, needed a full RMA on my fianc as well. The RMA was updated to reflect myself ( XXXX XXXX ) and my fianc ( XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I updated it again on request from Carrington on XX/XX/XXXX and all the required documents were uploaded and finalized on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not made aware of the outcome of the RMA like I was before and was under the impression that, and told by numerous Carrington representatives that the foreclosure proceeding would be put on hold while the RMA paperwork processed. So beginning on XX/XX/XXXX I start to receive unsolicited phone calls and text messages about buying my house, followed up by lawyers and law groups offering to represent me for my foreclosure? One of the advertisements from a local law office has a copy of the Notice of Lis Pendens that shows Carrington Mortgage initiated foreclosure proceedings against me in court dated XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXhree days after my final updated RMA was uploaded to their website. Further look in the court docket shows that Carrington Mortgage started foreclosure proceeding earlier that XX/XX/XXXX, but never made me aware of this- nor did I ever receive official documentation of this or the outcome of the final updated RMA . There were many inaccuracies in the foreclosure notice as well, in one document that county is listed wrong. 

Its been my intention to stay in the house all along. I made Carrington Mortgage aware of that at the very beginning. I have never received any official paperwork as pertains to the disaster assistance I was provided, the terms, or my rights under such an agreement. I have talked to numerous Carrington Mortgage staff and have received varying answers to specific questions concerning my mortgage from the beginning. Upon speaking to several  associates and supervisors I got the impression that they do not know how the foreclosure process works or are trying to cover for past mistakes, when I called on XX/XX/XXXX, they didnt know that the foreclosure was in the court system already and incorrectly stated that it was on hold. Carrington acted in bad faith in not clearing up whether I was under an assistance program or not and that when payments would be required. It is my desire to hold Carrington to the disaster assistance I was offered in the beginning, that I could make my normal mortgage payments and that the back mortgage would be rolled into the loan extending the payoff date. Carrington initiated foreclosure without properly informing me and my rights as a borrower under FHA guidelines. I also desire to look into the fees and fines charged to me under this disaster relief, foreclosure proceeding should have never been started so early into the process.",Mortgage

WE STRUGGLED GREATLY ALMOST FROM DAY 1- AS  THE MORTGAGE CRISIS SET UPON US , AND OIL  PRICES SKYROCKETED. WE FOUND THAT, AFTER THE BIRTH OF OUR XXXX CHILD, THE COST OF OUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT, OIL TO KEEP THE OLD HOUSE HEATED, AND CHILDCARE WAS FAR MORE THAN WE COULD HANDLE. 

WE ASKED FOR MODIFICATION, AND BANK OF AMERICA KINDLY SENT US THE PAPERWORK ( MORE THAN A FEW TIMES WE HAD TO REQUEST IT ), BUT EVERY TIME WE CALLED TO CHECK THE STATUS OF OUR REQUEST WE WERE FACED WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS WHO DIDNT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT OUR MODIFICATION. WE CONTINUOUSLY HAD TO RE-EXPLAIN OUR SITUATION AND RE-FILL OUT DOCUMENTS FOR WHAT WAS A FRUITLESS ENDEAVOR. WE NEVER RECIEVED A MODIFICATION OR ANY OTHER CONTACT WITH REGARD TO HELPING US. 

IN XX/XX/XXXX WE MOVED OUT OF THE HOME. WE CALLED BANK OF AMERICA TO LET THEM KNOW. THEY FAILED TO SECURE THE PROPERTY AND SEVERAL PIPES BURST- CAUSING QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE. THEY DIDN'T CONTACT US FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN REQUESTING PAYMENT -- WHICH WE ADVISED CONSISTENTLY THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. WE BEGGED THEM TO FORECLOSE SO WE COULD MOVE ON. THEY DID NOT.

Certainly we were aware there was going to be monetary consequences for breaking a lease, but in excess of {$6700.00} is unbelievable! I have disputed the charges ( EX : $ 1100+ fee for carpets where there were NO pets and we lived in the unit for less than 12 months ) and attempted to work out a settlement option for a reduced, reasonable, and affordable amount using our tax refund and every time I was told they do NOT do settlements and I can just pay what I can towards the balance until it is paid in full.

So I contacted NCC BUSINESS SERVICES onXX/XX/XXXX to see the status of the account. I spoke with a representative by the name of XXXX and asked him if this was open and if they were still collecting on it and he said "" yes ''.

He said because we were n't on unemployment, on SSI, disability etc. Which is actually inaccurate because for XXXX XXXX ( my ex who was also on the lease with me ) was unemployed during a portion of the time we lived in this apartment. However, I was still employed while all this took place and even asked ( during a previous call ) to do a single party settlement to remove my name only and pursue XXXX for the remainder and was denied this workout option as well.

The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. law firm, which has offices in XXXX, N.Y., and XXXX, N.Y., has filed papers with government agencies notifying them that it plans to close. It made the filings under a federal law requiring employers to provide notice before mass layoffs. 
"" Disrupting the livelihoods of so many dedicated and hardworking people is extremely painful, but the loss of so much business left us no choice but to file these notices, '' said XXXX XXXX in a statement issued on Monday.

"" In mortgage foreclosure proceedings, there are no excuses for sloppy practices that could lead to someone mistakenly losing their home, '' XXXX XXXX XXXX, the United States attorney in XXXX, said in a statement at the time of the settlement. "" Homeowners facing foreclosure can not afford to have faulty paperwork or inadequate evidence submitted, and today 's agreement will help minimize that risk.

"My mortgage was with XXXX XXXX. After signing, they notified me that they put the wrong insurance company on the paperwork and made me resign things. Then they sold it to Roundpoint XXXX. They immediately tried to raise my monthly payments because they said they had paperwork with the higher insurance price. I called XXXX and they supposively fixed it. 

Then in XXXXXXXX 2017, I get notification from Roundpoint that they were selling my mortgage. But after they decided to sell it, they did an escrow analysis and decided my payment should be increaed from {$1400.00} to {$1500.00}. When I contacted the new mortgage company, they told me that apparently Roundpoint was paying two different insurance companies ( incorrectly ) and that extra {$1200.00} was them mistakingly paying the new insurance. 

When they did their escrow analysis, they failed to notice they were paying two different insurance comanies. Instead they noticed a shortage for the year of {$1200.00} and decided that I should make it up PLUS increase my payment to cover it for the next year. So they raised my mortgage by {$200.00} knowing they were selling it and the new payment would be to the new company. 

However, because they sold it, they new company is unable to do an escrow analysis for 60 days and expected me to pay the extra money until they could. Thankfully, I asked my issue to be escalated and XXXX XXXX was willing to figure this all out.",Mortgage

More importantly, its predecessor, XXXX XXXX and others defaulted in the adversary proceeding. The U. S. Attorney General at XXXX in court said it was {$50000.00} as a claim - not {$70000.00}. Even then, he had no documents, the debt was in dispute and the U. S. Attorney at XXXX filed an improper pleading after asking for an extension to answer the Complaint. Since neither filed a Proof of Claim to verify the chain-of-title debt or to explain how the guarantor woukd have already paid the government, thus owing nothing to the federal government ; the credit report after that XXXX hearing stated those alleged federal debts were "" included in the Chapter XXXX discharge '' and were not collectible due to no proof. So my trial is XX/XX/XXXX, and I will now ask the judge to address this "" zombie debt '' for violations of the Fair Debt Collections Act regarding furnishing false information on my credit report given this never-ending nonsense. And also to address the new false furnishing on my credit report by this Credit Adjustments, Inc. The "" fresh start '' provision of the Bankruptcy Law afforded ample opportunity for the creditors to "" put up or shut up. '' They falsely claimed that it is my burden to prove "" undue hardship '' before they prove the debt is real. Moreover, the reverse is required. The government or its collectors must show chain-of-title proof prior to any proof on my part. They failed to do that. Now, the judicial admission that the debt was included is in keeping with the XX/XX/XXXX "" Dear Colleague '' letter by the XXXX XXXX XXXX guiding the creditors on legal costs relative to claims and other particulars. Also, XX/XX/XXXX is the deadkine for the Federal Register to receive comments related to "" undue hardship '' all of which will be addressed at trial XX/XX/XXXX.

More specifically, it is not entitled to that amount of {$20000.00} more on a one year time frame. That is usary. Also, it is using the U. S. Mail and committing mail fraud in defrauding me.

Incidentally, the XXXX XXXX XXXX was on the Matrix of Creditors and also failed to file a Proof Of Claim. In the beginning, a servicer failed to follow the federal regulations.

Now, a full year after the bankruptcy ended and the adversary proceeding began, I am going to file this letter with the court to get closure once and for all. There is a 57 % default rate on Income-Based Repayment recertification due to lack of work or lack of taxable income for which some rogue servicers wilfully trigger defaults. The XXXX XXXX XXXX makes it worse by offering a new IBR plan where it was denied at the beginning of the rogue servicer actions. They can't have it both ways. The XXXX got paid by their guarantor. So who has a valid claim? No one. All either defaulted or lied to got out of the case or otherise ignored the summons and complaint and the lead bankruptcy case completely. Despite that, it was either aware or directed after the XXXX hearing with the lawyer for the XXXX that it was futile.

"I have had ongoing issues both with getting my XXXX loan forgiveness amount of {$5000.00} taken off my account after being approved and with recalculating my payment amount under the REPAYE option after a significant change in income. 

In regards to the XXXX loan forgiveness program. I have 5 years of documented XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX and have submitted the necessary paperwork which has since been approved for loan forgiveness. However, it has been over 6 months since the paperwork was deemed complete and according to their representatives, approved. Yet, a "" computer glitch '' supposedly denied the amount be taken off my account after it was approved. They then tried to put me on administrative forbearance again as they resubmitted the request, which has in turn lessened my qualifying payments toward public service loan forgiveness. 

In terms of my monthly payment calculation, I have provided alternative income certification twice this past year because of two changes in income not represented on my tax AGI. The first one was processed accurately and the second one was initially processed accurately and then recalculated even though I did not ask for a recalculation and is over triple what they initially sent me as the new payment. The new recalculation does not match up with what the student loan repayment calculation or my pay stubs would determine as my estimated payment. I asked them to resubmit it for recalculation after a representative told me that the new calculation was incorrect. It came back with the same exorbitant amount they had previously recalculated. 

XXXX Loan Forgiveness Timeline XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my first application and it was subsequently denied because I the form submitted by one XXXX district was missing the title of that XXXX that signed it, the XXXX district was deemed ineligible because the XXXX had used the XXXX name of "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' instead of "" XXXX XXXX '' as it appeared on the Title I list, and was submitted prior to the close of the 5th XXXX year I had worked.

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX placed my account on administrative forbearance again without known cause. This meant that I was not making payments that would count toward public loan forgiveness during this time.

However, this information was verbal and not given in the letter regarding the placement of the forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX placed my account on administrative forbearance again without known cause. This meant that I was not making payments that would count toward public loan forgiveness during this time. It was later described to me that this forbearance was placed on the account because they had to resubmit my XXXX loan forgiveness paperwork for approval ( even though it had been previously approved according to their records ). This time, I pushed to speak to a supervisor and requested that the forbearance be removed from my account so that I could continue making qualifying payments toward public service forgiveness. 

Income Based Repayment Calculations XX/XX/XXXX Annual recertification due. Upon consolidation, my payment had been calculated based on our AGI from our tax transcripts. When asked to recertify, we provided alternative income verification as our income had significantly changed from the amount on our most current taxes due to a change in my spouses income. 

XX/XX/XXXX Payment was recalculated to be {$150.00} based on the alternative income verification provided. It is important to note that I have only made one payment of this amount because of the administrative forbearance placed on my account starting XX/XX/XXXX. I made a payment for XX/XX/XXXX while my application for a recalculation was being made because of a change in job and drop to nearly half of the previous income demonstrated back in XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I submitted the application and necessary pay stubs to have my payment recalculated since it had come off forbearance and we had a significant change in income not demonstrated in our tax transcript. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that my monthly payment under the RePAYE plan had been recalculated to be {$55.00} to begin XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received notification via email that my application for an IDR plan had been approved ( I  already had it approved a new payment recalculated XX/XX/XXXX and had not reapplied ). In the email it said my new payment amount would be {$290.00}. However, there was nothing to substantiate this email in my paperless inbox upon sign in. So I called and they agreed to recalculate the payment amount after a representative checked in with the department that processes these applications and they told me that it was a mistake and that the formula did not take into account my family size or other factors which is why it was incorrect. 

XX/XX/XXXX I receive a link in email to a notice in my secure inbox that states that my monthly payment had been recalculated to be {$290.00}. This occurred after the representative I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX submitted a request to recalculate. I am unsure why the recalculation is the same incorrect amount from the XX/XX/XXXX email. According to the notice, my new payments of {$290.00} are to start on XX/XX/XXXX. 

At this point, my main concern is that my approved teacher loan forgiveness amount of {$5000.00} is deducted form my balance and that my monthly payment amount is recalculated to match the initial notice I received after submitting alternative certification which was {$55.00}. I am also concerned that my public service loan forgiveness qualifying payments are properly demonstrated to include XX/XX/XXXX ( the first payment after the end of forbearance ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( which is being deducted in the amount of {$55.00} as a direct debit but not showing as due on my account because of the cancellation of the new forbearance that they tried to place on my account to resolve the teacher loan forgiveness dilemma ). 

I am including the documents of correspondence at this time because of identifying information related to my account. However, I am happy to provide the paper trail to verify the above timeline of information upon request.",Student loan

"I would like to express my feelings of despair coupled with immense anxiety that have been triggered the day I was lied to and misrepresented with false information. It is time to get to the bottom of it, thanks to the CFPB. 

On XXXX XXXX my husband leased a car from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The representative of the leasing company affirmed that my husband was approved for the lease, and the XXXX dealer will deliver the vehicle to our residence. 

I will clarify yet again, my husband signed for the lease, and I did not fill out any applications with my information. In fact, I do not have a drivers license ; I never had a drivers license. I have no need to lease a car and never intended to do so. Nevertheless, with the arrival of the new car, there were documents that required my signature. 

Since I am completely unfamiliar with the car leasing protocol, I followed the directives given by the driver that delivered the car. After my husband signed the lease agreement, the driver required a spousal signature since we live in the same household. He said that the paperwork request is mandatory for insurance purposes and handed over paperwork that he had prepared. My husband specifically asked about the nature of the documents to which the driver replied that by law when one gets an insurance quote, everyone residing in the household has to be listed on the policy even though they do not have a drivers license. He explained that it is urgent he gets my signature before he leaves otherwise there will be issue with the car insurance policy. 

My husband and the driver drove to my workplace in the new car, and the driver mandated my signature then and there and re-explained how important it is. I naively followed the instructions without giving out any of my personal information to XXXX XXXX XXXX and I signed on the basis that it 's required for insurance. 

The problem began when my husband unfortunately was involved in a accident. When he spoke to a XXXX representative, he was told the car is totalled and ca n't be repaired, he also affirmed that since he has full coverage "" As it 's mandated for a leased vehicle, it 's not possible to lease a car without full coverage insurance '' they will pay for the full value of the car. However, that was not the case. XXXX did not pay the full amount. ( I will attach the letter from XXXX to prove it, I 'm not here to say that XXXX did n't play a role in this mess, but I 'm submitting a seperate complaint for that ) XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed that I have gap insurance with XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as a damage waiver that will cover the remaining balance and therefore I should n't worry about the fact that XXXX did n't pay in full. 

I remember clearly my husband being on the phone with XXXX XXXX XXXX day after day since he always was ahead of his payments by 3-4 months and wanted to know if hell be refunded ( As you 'll see from the collection letter I 'll attach where it says Customers Payments, who was promised to be refunded to my husband since it was an overpayment ). 
After XXXX calls and many aggravating hours spent merely to reach a representative, my husband got through, and XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed that there is a overpayment ofapprox. $ XXXXand they will send the check in the mail for that amount. 

I will never forget the day when mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX arrived. Surprisingly, instead of receiving a check as promised, we received a detailed bill, which amounted to almost {$14000.00} ( Will attach a copy ) of what they claimed my husband is liable for. The frustration of receiving the bill was extreme. My husband contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was told that it was an error on their part and it will be taken care of promptly. In the meantime, while waiting for them to correct their error, my husband 's credit score dropped by 250 points. When he verified the reason for the credit drop, the only liability that showed up was XXXX XXXX XXXX account in delinquency!!!!! My husband called again and again and again and there was no one to talk to Nevertheless after over 1 hour and 15 minutes hold time, a representative answered, and transferred the call to the recovery department because he did not have access to our file since it was delinquent. 

Unfortunately, I 'm limited in the amount of words I can put into this complaint, and I will not have the ability to mention every single phone call of abuse and dishonesty and lies that was told. I WISH I WOULDVE RECORDED THEM, JUST TO SHOW THE CFPB HOW EVERY REPRESENTATIVE SAID SOMETHING ELSE!! 

What I do want to say is that a year after the XXXX delinquency appeared on my husband 's credit report and made an aggravating mess, it all of the sudden appeared on my credit report! "" "" Yes as I says it just began reporting to my credit reports!! I 'm not in any way joking, I purchased several times copies of my reports and since there 's no one to talk to at XXXX XXXX XXXX I contacted the credit bureas for help and all they told me was how I 'm able to dispute it and they will forward my dispute to XXXX '' '',,, This is entirely illegal, and should XXXX XXXX XXXX claim that I signed, I believe I made it clear how the driver fooled me into signing this on the basis that it 's for insurance. 

After disputing it several times with the 3 major CRAs the answer always came back with one statement "" WE VERIFIED THAT ALL INFO IS ACCURATE, but nothing more than this statement. And they would n't release any info on how they verified it. 

I ask the CFPB to explain XXXX XXXX XXXX my rights and educate them on the FCRA since I am a novice and give them this last chance to remove it and make things right.

"Bank of America keeps changing my account types without notifying me. I initially signed up for 2 free checking accounts in XX/XX/2009. One of the accounts had a free service ( overdraft protection ), which was supposed to automatically transfer funds into it from the other linked account, in the event it's balance is low. 

The free checking account was changed, without notifying me, to a different checking account ( now referred to as Core Checking ). The free "" overdraft protection '' now had a fee for each occurrence, and an additional monthly maintenance fee ( based on the new Core Checking account ) was being withdrawn from my account. 

These fees were withdrawn from my account for about a year before I noticed them. Perhaps it's just me ; I could have sworn that I had never seen the fees show up on my online account as I don't look at my online statements ( I opted to receive only eStatements ). 

I called to ask about the change and was advised that the account was no longer free and the fees associated with the Core Checking account. I was offered a new checking account option "" eChecking '' to avoid fees, which I took. 
The eChecking account was online only. It couldn't be used with checks, meaning you couldn't write a check to someone from the account. 

Just this month, I got charged a monthly maintenance fee on the same eChecking account. Good thing I caught it on time this time around right? When I called the customer service center to find out the reason for the fee, I was advised that the eChecking account was no longer offered and they had defaulted me back to the Core Checking account - again, I wasn't notified of the change. 

I believe this is a standard practice for BOA. They probably make these unannounced changes, on purpose, to collect fees from their customers and increase their revenue. These are probably carried out through carefully written algorithms to target certain customers after considering potential revenue they could generate from a particular group of customers.

"In in XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a Santander "" XXXX '' card at a branch in XXXX, MA. I also signed up for a checking account with them. I used both for a few months, and quickly realized the service was terrible and they were using deceptive business tactics. Just one example, the man who signed me up said there would be no annual fee whatsoever, yet there was. I closed the debit account, but continued using the card in certain circumstances so my credit would not be destroyed. In XX/XX/XXXX, I left for XXXX to work for a year. Before leaving, I paid off everything on the card. I pride myself for never being late on a payment for any card I have ever owned, I know the extreme consequences. After 2 weeks in XXXX, I checked again. There were no charges. Everything had been paid. After a couple months, I went to check on the account using the online banking system. After logging in, the system would automatically log me out after 5-10 seconds. I could enter all my information correctly, but the system would simply log me out. I am well versed in tech, and tried from different browsers, different computers, even my phone. Nothing worked. The error was with their system. I did not worry, since I had double checked all payments months before, and never used the card since. In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for another credit card and was sent a message that my credit score was poor and I was not accepted. I was bewildered, because I 've never missed a payment. I checked my XXXX card ( which I had no trouble logging in to ) and it was at XXXX $ balance. I tried to check Santander again, and encountered the same error - the system would boot me after 5-10 seconds. It was very difficult for me to call customer service, being in XXXX, so I tried every possible method to sign into the online banking. Nothing worked. Finally, I had to spend more money to call them internationally. I finally got an agent on the phone, and he was VERY slow in helping me, dragging out my international calling time further. He did not even realize what the problem was. After about 20-30 minutes I was finally able to glean that a charge had been added on in XX/XX/XXXX, over a month after leaving for XXXX. It was a motel charge from the USA for {$49.00}. This had never been paid and had ballooned into a charge of {$360.00}, destroying my credit in the process. To boot, I had never been notified by Santander via email, mail or anything else. I had never received any correspondence from them whatsoever, even a billing statement. I explained the whole story to the agent and he said there was NOTHING he could do. I was forced to call a second time, spending more money. The second time, they told me all they could do was apply a credit of {$35.00} dollars if I payed it right away. Fearing that they would be happy to throw on more extraneous fees if I did not pay it, and fought without payment, I payed the money. After paying the money, my online banking seemingly magically began to work. I do want to say it was a malicious act to earn them extra fees, but it seems awfully convenient that the banking system did not work, as they completely ignored sending me any statement simultaneously as a charge was added over a month later of paying my balance to XXXX. I am happy to pay the {$49.00} motel charge, but I feel I have done everything I could as a responsible consumer, and the fault lies with Santander 's service for not informing me, or even allowing me to view my account. The total charge ballooned to XXXX, of which XXXX $ is the annual fee I was lied about, and {$49.00} is the motel fee. After subtractacting the {$49.00} and the paultry {$35.00} they gave to "" make up '' for their extensive mistakes, I am owed {$270.00} by Santander.

This $ XXXX interest charge was added to my account AFTER my payment in full was made, was done without my knowledge and for which I never received a bill.

Because I subscribe to XXXX Credit Tracker, an alert made me aware on XXXX XXXX, 2016 that this account had been tagged as "" more than 30 days '' overdue. I investigated on XXXX website and made payment immediately to not let the credit damage worsen. I then immediately disputed the negative notation on my account - not the that the payment was late by 2 days according to XXXX XXXX records, but that it was "" late '' because XXXX XXXX had FAILED to make me aware of the charge. 

According to the FTC 's summary my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) -- XXXX Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or UNVERIFIABLE [ emphasis mine ] information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. '' Credit reporting agencies MUST correct UNVERIFIABLE information on my credit history. Yet all XXXX agencies have refused to do so even though XXXX XXXX CAN NOT VERIFY that I had knowledge of this {$3.00} interest charge, other than to say they mailed me a bill.

They simply accept XXXX XXXX UNVERIFIABLE claim when the VERIFIABLE evidence of my diligence in paying bills is reflected in the fact that I paid this charge IMMEDIATELY when I became aware of it! 

XXXX XXXX UNVERIFIABLE information should ALONE be reason enough for the reporting agencies to delete this negative notation from my credit history under the FCRA. But none of these parties will act on my disputes because they rely solely on XXXX XXXX for information, even though consumer reporting agencies "" must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or UNVERIFIABLE information. '' This inflexibility over {$3.00} is all the more galling given XXXX XXXX recent {$180.00} XXXX fine by the Consumer Protection Bureau -- for FRAUD. Why is the fraudulent XXXX XXXX organization more trusted by the credit reporting agencies than me?! 

Moreover, for the major reporting agencies to make a negative notation over a mere {$3.00} that will affect my otherwise spotless credit history for the next 7 years is a penalty utterly disproportionate to the supposed infraction. A 7-year sentence on my credit history for a disputed {$3.00} payment it not merely unfair, it qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment! 

What is a lone consumer like me to do when up against the impersonal, bureaucratized inflexibility of a too-big-to-fail bank and automated credit reporting systems with default algorithms, enforced by "" customer service '' automatons, that can not and will not take into account the simple human error of an undelivered piece of mail?

"Macy's/ Amex Fraudulently added penalties and interest to account. See below : XXXX XXXX, XXXX Macy 's , Inc. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX, OH XXXX RE : Customer Complaint Dear President /CEO : Often the interest in profiteering by large corporations creates an environment where numbers on paper become more important than individual customers. These customers are the reason the company engaged in merchandise sales and service will ultimately survive and prosper or fail. Turning a blind eye to that fact and poor decisions to increase profit on paper leads to programs, policies and third party administrators that completely alienate that which you rely on the most for business, your customers. To keep those customers, fairness and a proper resolution of problems with human beings is your life blood even though some in society engage in a less personal staring into a phone screen lifestyle. Your company will rely on and always need human beings that are customers that involve professional sales and service to purchase your merchandise. Part of the service with the shopping experience is your store credit. I opened an account with Macy 's and used it time and again. However it is your credit card and the service that is the reason we will not shop there again and I feel that it is important that you understand this so that you might be able to prevent failure as a business. 

Two weeks ago, I was called and told that I owed over {$250.00} on my Macy 's account and it was 120 days past due. I inquired for what had I purchased and not paid for in a timely manner. According to the "" Citibank '' caller a purchase was made on the store credit account for {$29.00} XX/XX/XXXX. The credit card expired on XX/XX/XXXX. The Card is in the name of and ends in XXXX. I have never received a statement, a bill or an overdue notice on that purported purchase either by mail or email. I have been in Macy 's and checked with the clerk each time I was in the Macy 's as a regular customer in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX making many holiday purchases using cash or otherwise since the card expired. I was told by multiple clerks that the card showed closed and there was a XXXX balance. In XXXX, I filled out an application to renew the card as it showed closed in XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received collections calls for the {$250.00} and when I was told that it was for the XXXX purchase, I asked to what was the other {$220.00} dollars for and was informed penalties and interest. It also showed a closed account in XXXX by expiration and there was no information about the renewal application I filed in XX/XX/XXXX even though I had received new cards showing the account open thru XX/XX/XXXX. So in less than 5 months a {$29.00} item increased almost 10 times its value without receiving a bill, statement or notice of past due in the regular mail or email at any time prior to the call which made me livid. The caller reviewed the computer screen, agreed with me and advised that they understood how I it was unreasonable. They then advised that penalties and interest would be reversed and I authorized payment for the {$29.00} item out of my bank. That caller also advised that there would be not negative credit rating on my record and if so that would be reversed as well. I was assured that I would receive an update that this had been corrected either by mail or email and it was not done. Repeated attempts at correcting this garnered inconsistent statements, false entries different than the card holder was told, multiple hang ups during critical times, continued calling when told not to call again, no response to further inquiries and adding on additional penalties, interest and fees while dispute is still pending with the company. It has been nearly 2 months with no response nor the account corrected.",Credit / Prepaid card

"I went to the Bank of America ( BoA ) branch XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY on Friday XXXX XXXX, 2015 to pay my credit card bill in person with the payment coupon provided by BoA for a bill due Tuesday XXXX XXXX, 2015.

I called BoA to fix the error on Monday XXXX XXXX, 2015 and I was told by the BoA representative that BoA would charge me interest for 7-10 business days after which time they would retract the interest from my next bill and apply my payment. 

I pay my bill in full every month and have had this card for 25 years. My payments that day ( I made XXXX cash payments to the same account ), if properly applied, would be for the full billing amount - no interest would be paid to BoA. I am unhappy that BoA misapplied my payment even though my payment coupon was printed for the proper account and that they are charging my account interest that they otherwise would not be able to ( by misapplying my payment to another account they prevented me from paying off said account in full ). Their solution to allow the interest to accrue and then take it off my next statement is unacceptable. By delaying the transfer of my payment to the proper account for 7-10 business days they hurt my credit and fraudulently charge me interest that they are not entitled to. 

When I asked the representative for a reference number for this transaction ( moving the payment to the proper account ) I was informed that BoA offers no such reference. I asked her for her name so I could have some verification that I discovered and reported to BoA the error in applying my payment and she would only give her initials. By refusing to provide me with verification for my request to fix BoA 's error, and only providing me with the initials of the representative after I pressed her for some type of verification, BoA gives the appearance of trying to set up the customer to suffer further errors ( BoA can always say they never got my call to fix their error, for instance ) in order to charge consumers more interest fraudulently.

"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing this letter as a complaint on my {$10000.00} pending chargeback dispute for my business card with American Express.

1. Facts I purchased a travel package bundle from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in early XX/XX/XXXX and paid for that product with two of my American Express cards : ( 1 ) card X and ( 2 ) card Y. Shortly after my purchase, I paid approximately {$5000.00} towards the balance on my card Y leaving approximately {$5000.00} in an outstanding balance.

Within a week of my purchase, I did not receive the product that I purchased and attempted to reach out to the vendor. After weeks of no response from the vendor, I called American Express and requested a chargeback on both of my cards. American Express representatives assured me that if I did not receive my product, I would be issued a chargeback for my purchase.

Within weeks after my chargeback request, a successful chargeback was placed towards my card X for the travel bundle purchase clearing the approximately {$20000.00} debt on that card. Card Y card, however, did not receive a chargeback. After hearing nothing for weeks, I called American Express and was told that the dispute was ruled in the favor of the vendor DESPITE BEING FOR THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT AND VENDOR.

Confused as to how one card, but not the other, would receive the chargeback, I then spoke with an American Express customer representative manager. I requested an explanation for why American Express ruled in favor of the merchant and was told that my contact information would be taken down for someone to explain to me the investigation. Per the managers recommendations, I requested opened a second chargeback dispute. I further offered myself to be a source of information for the dispute and requested that any chargeback investigators call me at my personal cell. Despite this, I heard nothing from American Express for three months. During this time, I was never contacted for information, learned about the status of my chargeback, or was given an explanation of the first chargeback result.

To my surprise and disbelief, I suddenly began receiving aggressive debt collector calls towards the end of XX/XX/XXXX demanding I pay the {$5000.00} outstanding balance on card Y. Upon calling American Express, I was abruptly told that the chargeback was ruled in the favor of the merchant again, and despite my multiple demands, was given no reason how or why the investigation ruled in favor of the merchant. To make matters even worse, multiple American Express refused to speak to me telling me there was nothing they could do further for me because my account was now outsourced to an external debt collector.

Frustrated and exasperated, I secured an evidentiary letter from the vendor stating that I never received the product that I purchased and that the vendor had gone bankrupt immediately after I purchased the product. Based on the letter from the vendor, American Express representatives reversed course and opened a third chargeback investigation. That chargeback investigation is now the topic of why I am writing this letter today nearly one year after the purchase.

2. Multiple Violations of 12 CFR 226.13, Truth in Lending Act American Expresss handling of my chargeback has resulted in multiple blatant violations of my rights under the Truth and Lending Act. They are as follows : Under 12 CFR 226.13 Billing Error Resolution, Section ( f ), American Express is required to conduct a reasonable investigation into my chargeback demand. The Consumer Finance and Protection Bureaus ( hereafter CFPB ) official interpretation of a reasonable investigation for a chargeback is : NONDELIVERY OF PROPERTY OR SERVICES : In conducting an investigation of a billing error notice alleging the nondelivery of property or services under 1026.13 ( a ) ( 3 ), the creditor shall not deny the assertion unless it conducts a reasonable investigation that the property or services were actually delivered, mailed or sent as agreed.

American Express has failed to conduct a reasonable investigation as required. The three investigations have consisted of calling the defunct vendor, not receiving a response, and ruling in favor of the vendor based on not receiving a response. These investigations have produced nothing aside from a non-response from the defunct vendor. They can not meet the statutory burden of proof that rests with American Express to show that I ( the debtor ) received the product that I purchased. This violation is made even more blatant considering ( 1 ) that American Express has already processed a chargeback on my other American Express card for the exact same product and vendor and ( 2 ) that I have furnished an evidentiary letter from the defunct vendor stating that I never received the product that I purchased.

Under 12 CFR 226.13 Billing Error Resolution, Section ( f ), if American Express determines that I am not due a chargeback, American Express must : ( 1 ) Mail or deliver to the consumer an explanation that sets forth the reasons for the creditor 's belief that the billing error alleged by the consumer is incorrect in whole or in part ; ( 2 ) Furnish copies of documentary evidence of the consumer 's indebtedness, if the consumer so requests.

American Express, despite my numerous written and oral pleas, has failed to produce any oral, written, or electronic explanation setting forth its belief that the billing error alleged by me is incorrect in whole or in part. After requesting to speak to an investigator to understand why my first two chargebacks were denied, I ( the debtor ) was told, on multiple occasions, that I can not talk to American Express investigators. In addition, a written demand for proof of documentary evidence of my consumer indebtedness was sent to American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX, Utah office and received via certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX. Documentary evidence of indebtedness, or for that matter a basic response, was never sent to me.

To make matters even worse, American Express has refused to do this for both chargeback investigations concluded on this card.

Under 12 CFR 226.13 Billing Error Resolution, Section ( c ) ( 2 ), American Express must conclude my dispute within 90 days : The creditor shall comply with the appropriate resolution procedures of paragraphs ( e ) and ( f ) of this section, as applicable, within 2 complete billing cycles ( but in no event later than 90 days ) after receiving a billing error notice.

American Express opened its first chargeback into my card on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, 190 days has passed a full 100 days and counting past the statutory limit.

3. Conclusion I hope these quickly identified violations of the Truth in Lending Act will prompt American Express to rectify from how it has bungled this chargeback. I am very eagerly looking forward to the CFPB 's response to my complaint.",Credit / Prepaid card

First they refused to honor a {$2500.00} check payable to me as the owner of the law firm where I am directly listed on the account as the owner, opener, and as the account holder, thus severely screwing up my accounts and balances - they state they changed their policy a month ago but no written notification has been provided to their customers and no reasonable time was provided before this branch launched into such a disruptive and ridiculous policy. 

Second when I went to open up an attorney escrow account they made it as a regular escrow account not an XXXX Account which was again their severe mistake, with a regular escrow accounts being charged maintenance fees when no fees are supposed to be assesses on attorney XXXX Accounts as per state and federal regulations.

"I noticed a collection debt on my credit reports and I disputed it because I had no idea what it was for. I received the dispute status back from the credit reporting agency and was informed that the debt remained. I contacted the company Central Financial and was informed that it was a bill from when I was XXXX. I informed the representative that they should have billed the insurance and then my Health Savings account that I provided to them in the ambulance and at the hospital prior. Somehow either the original hospital I went to did n't forward the information or they did n't bother to request reimbursement from the savings account credit card but instead they just sent it to collections. I never received anything contrary to what the company is stating. They are completely lying about sending me anything to show what the debt is for and ca n't even explain why they did n't submit the balance to the credit card/HSA card that should be on file. When I explained to the girl that I was willing to make a payment and take care of this bill but that they needed to delete it from my credit reports in return she informed me that they would n't. I informed her that it gave me no incentive to pay for it then so unless they remove it from my credit report then I would n't pay it at all. It 's not causing me any issues right now because it 's the only negative on my report and due to them not billing it correctly in the beginning, I now have to deal with this. I am willing to pay this bill now if they would agree to delete it from all XXXX credit reports that they have sent it too, otherwise it will delete off my report in another 5 1/2 years and I wo n't be paying anything. I do n't have a job at this time so I do n't have an income to even pay this bill, but I am still willing to take care of it thru my HSA account to get it removed from my credit report. They have to give me something in return since this is due to the practices of both XXXX XXXX and Central Financial Control who have both been in trouble for their billing & collection practices.

Without explanation, this account, which had been closed for over 5 years appeared on my credit report as over 120 days past due. Upon discovery, I contacted Macy 's, who then referred me to Citibank, who was indicated as the card issuer. I spoke to a representative at Citibank who advised that there was a {$8.00} balance remaining on the card. She could not offer an explanation of how this account which was closed over 5 years ago with a zero balance suddenly had a {$8.00} balance. However, she was able to refer the matter to another group within Citibank for resolution.

Although, she could not confirm this is what happened to my account, she did say that she had seen it before. 
I requested XXXX 's help in correcting my credit report, however she said her department did not handle that, and that the department that did could not be reached by phone.

"XX/XX/XXXX CFPB : JPMChase ARM Loan XXXX XXXX Accounting violates Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Standards for verifiability. Verifiability QC26. Verifiability helps assure users that information faithfully represents the economic phenomena it purports to represent. Verifiability means that different knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful representation. Quantified information need not be a single point estimate to be verifiable. A range of possible amounts and the related probabilities also can be verified. QC27. Verification can be direct or indirect. Direct verification means verifying an amount or other representation through direct observation, for example, by counting cash. Indirect verification means checking the inputs to a model, formula, or other technique and recalculating the outputs using the same methodology. An example is verifying the carrying amount of inventory by checking the inputs ( quantities and costs ) and recalculating the ending inventory using the same cost flow assumption ( for example, using the first-in, first-out method ). QC28. It may not be possible to verify some explanations and forwardlooking financial information until a future period, if at all.

"This complaint is not a duplicate of any previously filed complaint. It is representative of new violations that have recently occurred. This complaint is filed because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hereafter XXXX XXXX ), as of XX/XX/2017 has violated Section 623 ( 5 ) ( A ) and Section 605 ( c ) ( 1 ) of Fair Credit Reporting Act. WHEREFORE, XXXX and XXXX XXXX is asking for a cease and desist order compelling XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX to correct the record. Any debt that may have existed is now and forever time barred. 
1. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, has, ( a ) Re-aged account No. XXXX, previously reported as Acc. No. XXXX, and, ( b ) reported information beyond the 7.5 year statutory period allowed by FCRA, and, ( c ) Failure to report the account as "" DISPUTED '' as required by FCRA. 
2. Both the original creditor or a debt collector can not re-age a negative account. No matter how many times a delinquent account is transferred or sold from one debt collector to another, the date of first delinquency should not change. The DOFD ( date of first delinquency ) determines how long a negative account can remain on your credit reports. ( see exhibit-A, -B, -C ) 3. A negative credit item, such as a charge-off can remain on our credit report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. Any collection agency that may end up with the charged-off account must comply with that same date. 
4. Section 623 ( 5 ) ( A ) says : "" In general. A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action shall, not later than 90 days after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action. '' 5. This means that if a debt collector reports a date of first delinquency to the credit bureaus and the original creditor previously reported it, the dates must be the same date of first delinquency. Any different date constitutes illegal re-aging. 
6. A debt collector re-aging an account can cause serious damage to our credit files. Re-aging would allow the collection account to remain on our credit reports in-perpetuity. This action has been taken because we, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX believe we are victims of re-aging. 
7. Furthermore, Once an account has been charged off, the date of first delinquency should never change because it starts the clock on the 7-year reporting time period. 
8. In actuality the 7-year reporting period is really 7 years plus 180 days ( 7.5 years ). This is how long a negative item such as a charge-off can remain on a credit report. 
9. A charge-off past the 7.5 year reporting date should not be on our credit reports. This includes any collection account connected to that charge-off account. 
10. Even if XXXX XXXX collection effort began yesterday, XXXX XXXX can attempt to collect the debt if there any, but they are prohibited from reporting the debt past the 7.5 year reporting period. 
11. Furthermore, the account has been disputed. However, the current credit reports for me and my spouse, XXXX XXXX XXXX does not reflect the dispute.",Debt collection

After 60-days the credit services issued the credit back to the card and once the money was sent to my account it was later removed due to Home Depot sending an investigation letter regarding charges that were under dispute after the refund date.

After about a year, I found out that although I had continued to receive a monthly bill ( and paid each month ), XXXX XXXX had placed my account in deferment without my permission because they received notice that I was in school. I immediately called, asked for the forms to be sent to me to nullify the deferment. I mailed and faxed these forms and was told that XXXX had not received them. I repeated the process and was told that the unauthorized deferment had been cancelled and ALL of the payments made in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX would count as qualifying payments. I wrongly assumed this matter was closed. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my employer certification form as I have annually. A typo on the date prevented the form from being submitted. I resubmitted the form and had my employer verbally confirm the information to XXXX over the phone. XXXX denied my application again and said it was incomplete, they needed information over the phone from my employer. I repeated the process and XXXX also contacted our HR department themselves. HR provided the necessary information again and still my re-certification was not approved because XXXX stated they had never spoken to my employer. Process was repeated again and finally in XX/XX/XXXX my employment was re-certified for the period of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX to ask why I hadn't received information outlining my number of qualifying payments. The agent said "" it could still be processing, but I can tell you that you have made 34 qualifying payments.

He found that XXXX had never counted my payments from the time I was in a XXXX program in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX and filled out paperwork stating that I did not authorize XXXX to place my account in deferment and was told that the deferment was cancelled and ALL payments made during that period would be counted. This agent also told me there was a payment in XX/XX/XXXX that didn't count because it was XXXX cents ( not {$12.00}, XXXX cents ) less than it should have been. I really couldn't understand how that even happened and I generally pay a little extra on my TEACH grant ( which was turned into a loan ) each month so that didn't make sense to me. He told me he would submit that payment as well as the ones that were made during the period when XXXX placed a deferment on my account ( not authorized by me and they continued to send bills to me which I paid ) for review to have them applied to my qualifying payments. This customer service agent was very helpful, but he informed me that once this was sent to be reviewed, he couldn't give me any information on how it would be handled. Additionally, he told me this process would take 90 days to 6 months.

After explaining the problem I was told that they would transfer the money back to my checking account in 3 to 7 days even though I told them that they had taken the money from my account and I needed the money to pay bills now. 
Seven days later ( XXXX XXXX or so ) I called again since they had not returned the money yet. I was told by XXXX that I had to wait 10 to 15 days and they would then send the information to another group who would write a physical check and then mail it out to me. I told them that this was not acceptable. She told me she would check on what they could do and get back to me within two hours. She never called back. 
I was away the week of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and found a few messages on my answering machine when I returned. XXXX from the President 's line at Capital one 360 told me that since I did not answer all of her calls she would not call back again but she left a number ( XXXX extension XXXX ) where I could call her. I called on XXXX XXXX but have not received a call back yet. 
Also on my return last week I found an overnight envelope propped against the door. It contained a check From Capital One made out for the wrong amount from a nonexistent account. 
I would like to have them return the money quickly. If necessary by deposit in my checking account with them and to ensure that they do not take another payment in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I submitted a claim to the wrong department in New York State and they said that they have referred the claim to this agency but I need to make sure because the money that Capital One took from my account is needed to pay tax bills this month.",Mortgage

"Greetings, I have had a Wells Fargo credit card since XX/XX/XXXX. I have never missed a payment. When I opened this account my interest was a little less than 15 %. Now it is 19.8 %!!!! 

I just found this out because my interest charge keeps going up even though I am paying the principle down and started making inquiries. 

During my last couple years in college, I did escalate the principle. In XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the XXXX, Colorado Wells Fargo bank seeking to refinance. I was told then that my interests rate on the card was around 15 %. Based on this I decided not to refinance. However, in my recent conversation with a Wells Fargo executive, they said my interest rates have always been nearly 20 % since XX/XX/XXXX!!!!! They claimed the bank in XXXX, must have looked a wrong information. That does not pass the smell test. I have no idea how long I have been being ripped off by Wells Fargo. 

I make two payments even month when I get paid, so I am always two weeks ahead of the due date, which is at the endow the month. However, their computer and data entry is not keeping up with my payment history, often showing I owe a payment even though I have already met my monthly obligation well in advance. 

Also, I used the card back in XX/XX/XXXX for {$700.00} for tires, but turned around and paid {$800.00} to the card, seven days later, but was still charged interest on the tires! 

I believe I have been outrageously overcharged in interest fees and how they are accruing my monthly averages.

"In Mid-XX/XX/XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a credit card account with Wells Fargo on the internet website wellsfargo.com. My husband did the same. Both applications were submitted within twenty-four hours of each other and for the same credit card type ( "" Wells Fargo Cash Wise VISA Signature Card ' ). The information submitted with the applications included the same address and telephone number. Both of us received letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IA, XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that acknowledged our applications and stated that : We can approve your application if we are able to verify certain information by XX/XX/XXXX. 
What you need to do Please call us by XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ... 

When we called that number, we were told that Wells Fargo needed to verify our identities. We were directed to visit a Wells Fargo Bank branch and present a government ID plus non-Wells Fargo financial account information plus vehicle registration or insurance information, all in our name in order to satisfy the Wells Fargo identity verification process. We complied with the request by jointly visiting the Wells Fargo Bank branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California, on XX/XX/XXXX. We presented the requested documents. All documents showed our correct names and our correct address. Copies of all documents were faxed from the branch office to another Wells Fargo office by the bank employee, XXXX XXXX. 

Two days later, I received a letter from Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that stated : ... After another careful review, we are not able to approve your application at this time. 
About your application We are unable to offer you a credit card account because : Identity ca n't be verified. 

When I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, to inquire whether they had made an error the representative told me that there was no error and that Well Fargo 's decision with respect to this matter was final. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that confirmed Wells Fargo 's decision. 
My husband also called Wells Fargo. He was told his application was approved and that no error had been made. He received a confirmation letter from Wells Fargo XXXX, datedXX/XX/XXXX, that stated Thank you for opening a new Wells Fargo Credit Card account. Your credit card, ... .., will be arriving soon .... 
Shortly thereafter, he received his Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Signature credit card and used it. 

Please note that there was no derogatory information on my credit reports, that my credit score was not substantially different from my husband 's, and that there was no substantial difference in our credit histories. Hence, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to credit worthiness. 
My husband and I have lived at the same addresses for many years, the last five years at the address submitted on the credit card applications and shown on all documentations provided to Wells Fargo for the identity verification process. During all these years, we have had the same joint telephone numbers. We both submitted all requested documents to Wells Fargo to comply with their identity verification process. In addition, I had and have active Wells Fargo debit and credit cards as part of joint accounts with my mother. These joint accounts show my identity ( name, social security number, DOB, address ) being identical to the information provided in the application. On XX/XX/XXXX, while in the branch office of XXXX XXXX submitting the documents for the identity verification process, I also requested a replacement debit card. It promptly arrived in my mail a few days later. Thus, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to verification of identity. 
As stated above, XXXX XXXX XXXX, assured me on the phone that the denial of my application was final and not an error and followed up with another letter re-stating the denial. At the same time, Wells Fargo XXXX. assured my husband on the phone that the approval of his application was not an error and followed up with a letter confirming the opening of his credit card account. Therefore, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been made in error. 
Both of our applications were submitted to and processed by Wells Fargo XXXX. at the same time. Hence, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to changes in approval/denial procedures, guidelines, or rules. 
Both of our applications and subsequent submittal of documents were sent to identical Wells Fargo XXXX. locations. Thus, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to local differences in approval/denial procedures, guidelines, or rules. 
In conclusion, I have to assume that Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine was made wholly or in substantial parts on the basis of the only significant differences in our applications or related information, i.e., on the basis of age, sex, race, national origin, religion, or color.

She advised to call Bayview & try to get them to accept the full amount due so that attorney 's fees would n't be due. After MANY calls, I finally got to speak to someone, was emailed a new demand letter. Surprisingly, the demand letter included attorney 's fees of over {$800.00}. How could this be valid when I just spoke to the attorney 's office and they did n't even have a file on me? I 'd like to see the attorney 's bill, because I do n't think there is one. 
While speaking to Bayview 's asset manager, I questioned why they would n't call or send a letter explaining that my terms would n't be accepted? She stated a XXXX term that I 've since forgotten, that was basically legal jargon meaning that they could not call me, and she did not know why I was placed into that status. She requested me to write a letter to them to be removed from that status. 
I never wrote the letter, however early in the following next month I was called by a CSR regarding that month 's payment of {$1300.00}. I questioned the payment because it 's normally around {$900.00}. She stated that there were {$460.00} in late fees. I tried to explain that I had paid the {$460.00} in late fees the prior month to get my house out of foreclosure. She told me to contact my attorney. I said "" what attorney '', and she replied "" your bankruptcy attorney '' ... ..? I have never been in bankruptcy! They are still trying to collect the {$460.00} in late fees which were already included in the demand letter which I paid in full. 
The reason that I 'm writing to you is because I have completely lost trust in the ability of Bayview to handle my loan fairly and responsibly. The CSR 's are very unprofessional, very difficult to reach by phone, do n't return phone calls, carelessly make make notes to my account, did n't properly credit my account after a payment of {$6800.00}, and apply charges that are not valid. Another inconsistency was the fact that XXXX XXXX sent me a demand letter via email, stating "" I am here to assist you '' and provided his direct number. When I called, his very lengthy voicemail ( in English and XXXX ) stated that he was on vacation and not returning to the office for another two weeks! 
I 'd like the late fees to be credited, and my account reviewed to see what else they 've messed up.",Mortgage

I called the Western Union customer service number to immediately stop payment but the customer service number is strictly an automated system with no recourse to speak to a live person about dealing with the immediate situation. I was desperate to stop payment on the money orders as they were either lost or stolen. The automated instructions were to filed a Money Order Customer Request which takes six to eight weeks. I sought the help of a consumer help advocate in XXXX who dug up a Western Union fraud phone number But when I called them the person said there was nothing they could do to stop payment and I would have to fill out the form and wait up to eight weeks for payment to be stopped on the lost or stolen money orders. only then would a stop payment be issued and only if the money orders had not been cashed. If someone had stolen them and cashed them then I wold have to file a report with the local police to try and get my money back. I tried to explain that I am a XXXX XXXX from combat XXXX and live on a small medical stipend and that I could lose my rental house if I did not pay soon. The person said sorry and hung up on me.

"A few months ago, I bought some anti-virus software from a scam company called XXXX. They convinced/tricked me into thinking that I was receiving a refund and that I had double the money in my checking account ( Over {$2000.00} to increase of over {$5000.00} ).

"Summary : Had a credit card, was paying debt. Became unemployed and unable to pay ( XX/XX/XXXX ), account went to collections. In XXXX XXXX, got a temporary part-time job and made arrangements with the creditor - XXXX to pay $ XXXX/month. Started XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX ( I 'm told ), the account was charged-off. I have been making $ XXXX monthly payments to creditor since then. XXXX XXXX, I wrote to them to tell them to "" STOP CALLING ME. '' I said nothing about them not doing anything else. XX/XX/XXXX, they replied they "" received [ my ] your request to close the above referenced account. '' WHAT??? And then later in the letter : "" If you would like to may payment arrangements to resolve this issue, please contact us at XXXX. '' Huh??? I already made payment arrangements with them when it was discussed and I agreed to do $ XXXX/month - all I could do ; and notified them in the letter that I 'd let them know if/when my situation changed. 

So, my question is this : If the creditor talked with me, stated/negotiated ( almost begging ) an amount and accepted the payment amount I could make, AND has been accepting ( and acknowledging - receipt of ) those payments every month - for a debt that was Charged Off XX/XX/XXXX ; do they then have any right to refuse current payments I make, in an attempt to say I was not "" paying as agreed, '' or to make it seem as if I have not been paying? What is my right as a consumer? What is their right as a creditor? 

I have another letter to write to them, accompanying the next payment I 'll be sending, to let them know they did not follow my letter, or misinterpreted it, and further - they did not acknowledge receipt/crediting the payment ( per letter as they have done for over a year - prior to my letter of request ).

"PayPal Transaction ID : XXXX On XX/XX/2018, an associate attempted to send me {$500.00} through PayPal, from her personal PayPal account to my personal PayPal account. PayPal offers a method of sending money using a recipient 's telephone number, which is the method used by my associate.

The {$500.00} went to another PayPal account holder instead of me.

The issue here -- besides still not receiving that money, is that PayPal seems to think it's okay to have one phone number for multiple accounts. If the phone number is the only account-identifying recipient information needed, the security of that money transfer is questionable.

Which account holder will receive the money?

Since this incident, I have spent several hours on the phone with them, and actually won a reversal of the {$500.00}, only to have that reversal rejected by their fraud team. Attempts to speak with their fraud team have resulted in being placed on hold for hours at a time.

Based on the bias assumption held by the bank manager that XXXX XXXX provided errant information, did that perverse assumption interfere with her doing her job of monitoring the paper checks for accuracy before signing them? The only way for us to find out what the bank manager 's actions were is to have the bank produce these checks. The original scenario suggested by XXXX XXXX is more fitting as to what happen then the prevarication offer by the Bank. XXXX XXXX suggested that the clerk entered the wrong information and that when the Bank Manager realized that she signed the paper check with the wrong address, she and her employee colluded and manufactured a bogus story.

"I had an agreement with : MCA Management Company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, MO XXXX or one of their many expired fictitious names First I contacted them about debt in XX/XX/XXXX. I did so in XX/XX/XXXX. They made no mention of any alternate options I may have had to settle the obligation and made an agreement with me. They agreed to remove the debt from my credit reports in exchange for regular payments automatically deducted from my checking account. I made those payments every month as accepted. 

Late last year, I switched banks. As is common these days, I had 15+ billers with access to my bank account, including utilities, credit cards, store cards, etc. I did not remember all of them. All of the companies understood and these billing clerical errors were immediately resolved. MCA Management Company and XXXX XXXX did not. XXXX XXXX, of MCA Management Company and/or her company immediately fired off 4+ separate credit bureau negatives, but now under the original creditor 's name, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, rather than what used to be their own. even though it was previously combined as one. Upon contacting her in multiple attempts, in good faith, offering to catch up on the two payments immediately, and courteously explaining the situation, this person, XXXX XXXX was unreasonable, offered zero empathy, and seemed to revel in her ability to affect my credit shortly before my family attempting to buy the home we have resided in for 12 years. XXXX XXXX may have committed blatant malfeasance and caused my distress, psychological, financial damages. 

As though none of this happened, she or her staff has resumed calling me. MCA Management company is notorious for this behavior is predatory in their practices. They put personal gain, and seemingly sadistic satisfaction ahead of any interests of the region and community they operate in. 

Also attempt to mislead consumers by using a DBA, tied to the same acronym of MCA. They refer to themselves sometimes as MCA Management Company, and other times as Medical Commercial Audit Company Inc. Even a third time as simply MCA Management. In reality the only valid name I can find is actually, "" MCA MAnagement Company/Medical-Commercial Audit Inc. '' This is inconsistent and demonstrates a lack of transparency. Furthermore, they do not provide a physical address anywhere. They are using a PO Box as their business address. They have actually registered their business as a Post Office Box, which from my understanding is not permitted. There is a "" workaround '' to do this, but I'm not sure this is legitimate. 

For whatever reason, the owner, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in addition to operating under multiple expired names, and a P.O.

"I have had my XXXX XXXX/Bank of America Credit Card for XX/XX/XXXX. For the first year, I would call in every month and make a payment on the credit card. I was finally sick of calling in each month so in XX/XX/XXXX when I called to make my payment, I asked if they could set me up for reoccurring payments each month. The man that I spoke with was very hard to understand and there was a little bit of a language barrier. I politely asked him to speak with someone else and he insisted that he understood what I was asking for and he could help me. I asked the man to set up reoccurring payments for the minimum payment due each month. He insured me that he did so, and the conversation ended. Stupidly, I put my trust in Bank of America to put the right people in place to DO THEIR JOB and I did n't check on that card for another four months or so. Because I do n't regularly use that card, I did n't feel the need to check on it. ( Keep in mind ) I have proof that my account was current and all my payments were made prior to this man setting up my auto pay. Long story short, the man that set me up for auto pay DID NOT put in the minimum payment amount, he put in a payment amount that was just under the minimum required amount. So for six months Bank of America has been taking {$40.00} out of my checking account and applying it to my credit card, THE PROBLEM IS that this is not the minimum amount, so for six months my account has been getting charged late fees and interest. I went into the Bank of America office in my city and they could not believe what was going on. They continued to apologize and they called the customer service line for me while I was there. Bank of America acknowledged that they were wrong but they still wanted me to pay over {$400.00} up front to get my account back to current, and then they would credit my account two months later. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard, I 'm hoping and praying that someone can see that this is FRAUD! Recently Bank of America closed my account, but they are still taking out the {$40.00} a month. I understand that mistakes happen, and it was the ignorance and lack of focus of one individual in that company that caused this problem.

"This is a multifocal complaint. It will be submitted in it 's entirety to each individual department as instructed by XXXX, XXXX and the Georgia state XXXX Office. 
In XXXX we obtained a fixed rate second mortgage on our home through XXXX XXXX. Country Wide home loans was the originator of the mortgage. Bank of America NA acquired the mortgage when they purchased Country Wide. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX a set of unfortunate circumstances lead to a foreclosure on our home by XXXX, the servicer of our primary mortgage which was an FHA backed mortgage. Our second lien should have, per Georgia law been extinguished and traditionally the monies owed would have been designated as an unsecured loan which we would have continued paying to BofA. This did not happen. According to XXXX in the BofA foreclosure department, a mortgage insurance claim was filed on our account in XXXX. The loan remained designated as a mortgage while "" waiting for a determination by insurance ''. XXXX stated the claim was denied in XXXX at which time BofA formally release the lien on the property in XXXX of XXXX and attempted to convert the loan into an unsecured loan and have us resume payments. It remains a mystery as to how they held the lean three years beyond the date of foreclosure even after the home sold in XXXX of XXXX. The loan was rejected by the installment loan department and reverted to the foreclosure department. XXXX stated a second claim for mortgage insurance was filed in XXXX. He also stated that due to "" bankruptcy issues with the mortgage insurance companies, 'executives ' are working on a lump sum settlement for all claims. Once a settlement is reached, the remaining balance of this loan will be charged off. '' He described my account as a "" foreclosed mortgage carrying a designation of property conveyed by foreclosure '' and further advised me that my account is locked, and that no payments can be excepted pending the insurance determination and no documentation can be released on the account. BofA continues to report this account as an open active mortgage and assigns a new 30 day late payment every month to both XXXX and XXXX. It reports it as an unsecured installment loan with a new late payment each month to XXXX. Obviously, the loan is either a foreclosed mortgage or an unsecured debt not both. If it is a foreclosure, there should be no late payments reporting following the date of the foreclosure. If it is an unsecured loan, why was it not converted to a charge off after 180 days of delinquency and why can we not work out some form of payment for this debt and how have they filed for mortgage insurance on a loan that is not a mortgage? Multiple BofA representatives have attempted to make it possible to accept payment but are blocked by "" flags '' presumably arising from the mortgage insurance claim. I attempted to obtain documentation from BofA regarding their description of the account to provide to their credit reporting department pursuant to a request for documentation from that department. I was told that the account was locked, that no documentation could be released and that my "" attempts at legal discovery will have to take another route ''. This was a surprising and troubling statement as I am unaware of any litigation involving my account.

"I am having a lot of trouble with getting Citizens Bank to refund a {$1000.00} mistakenly made payment to a closed line of credit account. I appreciate any help your offices can lend to my efforts to receive repayment of this money. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mistakenly made a {$1000.00} payment to Citizens Bank from my checking account at XXXX Bank. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citizens Bank to inquire about the status of this payment. I was told there was no overpaid balance shown on the closed line of credit account. Citizens Bank was unable to tell me where the payment went to with their bank, thus opened case # XXXX to start to locate the payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I again called Citizens Bank about the lost payment, and a possible reversal of the bank debit from my checking account at XXXX Bank. Citizens Bank recommended I call XXXX Bank about this. I immediately called XXXX Bank who told me they can not make the reversal, but that I needed to wait for Citizens Bank to make the repayment, usually within a few days of their receiving it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citizens Bank for a status on their efforts to make my repayment. Citizens Bank told me a check for {$1000.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX, and held for XXXX days until XX/XX/XXXX before being released. The telephone representative told me the check was sent to my home. The address was correct. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, with no check received, I again called Citizens Bank. The customer service representative "" XXXX '' transferred me to "" XXXX '' in their Credit Card Disputes department. From there, I was again transferred to "" XXXX '' in their Loan Solutions department. From there I was again transferred to "" XXXX '' in their Consumer Finance department. XXXX told me the same details that the check was issued on XX/XX/XXXX, and held for XXXX days before sending off, and that it should be in my mail box within a few days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, still with no check received, I again called Citizens Bank. The customer service representative "" XXXX '' in Consumer Finance told me that this day was day XXXX after the check was sent on XXXX XXXX, and that I needed to wait another several days for it to arrive. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, still with no check received, I again called Citizens Bank. The customer service representative "" XXXX '' in Consumer Finance told me that the check was written on XX/XX/XXXX, but now was held until XX/XX/XXXX before sending out. XXXX had no explanation for this delayed payment. XXXX gave me Citizens Bank 's check number XXXX as the check used to repay me. XXXX also told me the check was written from Citizens Bank 's XXXX, Rhode Island center. I stressed to XXXX that it is not a long distance from XXXX RI to the XXXX MA area, and that it should only take a day or XXXX for delivery. XXXX advised me that if no check was received soon, that I should call their Consumer Finance department again, and ask for a supervisor to have a replacement check written. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, still with no check received, I again called Citizens Bank. The customer service representative "" XXXX '' in Consumer Finance told me that there was no record of any contact regarding my request for repayment. XXXX also did not recognize the claim number XXXX opened on XX/XX/XXXX, and gave no explanation for this absence of customer calls from me. XXXX did make a replacement check request # XXXX, saying that it will take about XXXX to XXXX business for this to be addressed, and that the check, when written, would be held for XXXX business days before being actually sent. I complained to XXXX that Citizens Bank should be over-nighting me the payment immediately in light of all the troubles encountered. XXXX had no control over the mailing of the payment, only the request. 

Because of Citizens Bank 's lack of maintaining records of my calls, I immediately called the offices of XXXX XXXX, Citizens ' treasurer in XXXX, RI. To protect my interest, as well as others ', someone in the bank 's corporate office needs to know of this practice. I did not speak directly with XXXX XXXX, but did with "" XXXX '' in their Customer Service department. XXXX took down details of my situation, and forwarded it to the office of XXXX for action. XXXX also gave me a case number XXXX as reference of the message to the XXXX 's office. XXXX told me someone will be in contact with me within several days on this matter. 

On this date, I also contacted the offices of Massachusetts XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, MA to ask about what I can do to have Citizens Bank act on my situation. XXXX XXXX 's office recommended I contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for help. Any help you can lend is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you.",Other

"I was a loyal Chase credit card customer for almost a decade. In XX/XX/2016 I left my job and it took me two months to find a new one. Chase has been repeatedly calling me - I find several messages on my caller ID every day. 
When I landed a new job, I spoke with Chase on XX/XX/2016 and informed them I was starting a new position and I would be able to catch up XX/XX/2016. The person on the phone said he 'd note this, and the calls would stop. 
The calls did not stop : on XX/XX/2016 I answered the phone and was again told I was late. When I asked the person on the phone if there was a record of my previous conversation, she said there was but "" company policy is to call every five to seven days to see if anything has changed. '' This is absurd : I informed them when I could pay them, there 's no reason for them to be constantly calling me when the date has not passed yet.

I was questioned about how I was paying other bills, and asked if I had someone else I could borrow from to place the loans in forbearance. I explained that I do not have anyone I can borrow from. Navient told me there was nothing they could do to help me until I had money to place my loans in forbearance. I also asked if I would have to pay an additional fee to keep my monthly loans in forbearance. Navient said yes, I would have to pay another {$50.00} per loan to keep in forbearance, at the end of each month. I told Navient I would have to call back, because I do not have the funds at this time. The support agent said I could schedule a payment for up to two weeks in advance. I explained that I would still not be able to make any payments in two weeks. I will not be able to make any payments for at least 3 months with my current income status.

"I first received a letter from Midland Credit Management ( MCM ) on XXXX/XXXX/2014 offering to settle an alleged debt originally owed to XXXX Bank at a 40 % discount. I responded with a request for validation of the debt, both that a debt is owed AND that the debt is owed by me. MCM failed to provide the requested validation. 

MCM did, however, exactly XXXX months later send me basically the same letter with the same offer. As they had failed to provide validation the XXXX time, and as the alleged debt would have been time-barred for legal action anyway, I replied again asking MCM to either prove the debt or cease contact. 

Several weeks later, on XXXX/XXXX/2014 I received yet another letter from MCM. Finally, an acknowledgement of my dispute. The letter makes no reference, however, to the XXXX prior attempts I made to validate the debt, just to the dispute I had filed with XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ( CRAs ) explaining how they were continuing to report the debt despite MCM having failed repeatedly to validate. 

In this letter, they only blamed me and the CRAs, instead of addressing the issue at hand. They stated the CRAs did not provide them with specifics of why I was disputing the alleged debt. They did, and I had already provided them a list of reasons. The CRAs are reporting the account based on information MCM provides. For them to continue displaying knowingly false information, or information not permitted to be included in my file, is a FCRA and FDCPA violation. Likewise, for MCM to continue verifying this information to the credit reporting agencies after they have failed multiple times to provide validation is also a violation of the FCRA and FDCPA. They also, in the letter, ask ME to prove I do not owe this debt, either with receipts of a police report proving fraud. As with the reporting to and by the credit agencies, the burden of proof is not on ME. I am not claiming fraud nor identity theft. And I can not prove I paid a debt I do even know exists or is mine. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2014 I received yet another letter from MCM. This time the letter includes : an open date of the alleged original XXXX account, the alleged balance due acquired by MCM, and a partial social security number. Please tell me that is not the best they can do as far as providing validation of this debt, as they have proven nothing? 

On XXXX/XXXX/2014 I received XXXX letters from MCM. 

The first asked for the contact information of my attorney. I do not have an attorney and do not need an attorney at this time. I have attempted several times to have documentation provided that this debt exists, that I owe it, and that MCM is legally entitled to collect it. They have failed to provide requested documentation, yet they continue to report the account to the credit reporting agencies inaccurately and continue to make efforts to collect this debt. The debt is time-barred from legal action, and any threat of legal action ( or actual legal action ) would be a violation of the FDCPA. What I wrote to them was that I was filing complaints with the BBB and CFPB, and if those complaints failed to resolve the matter, I would contact a consumer attorney to see what my right are. 

The second, as MCM has done previously, stated that they do not have enough information to investigate my complaint. The letter has my name, was sent to my current address, and has MCM 's account identifier. And I have provided all the information previously. And they both update and review my credit files monthly, so they clearly have all the information they need.",Debt collection

The Bank then debited a {$75.00} ACH charge from the account ( {$49.00} - {$75.00} = [ $ XXXX ], resulting in a {$35.00} fee.

"I have initiated an investigation into a fraudulent student loan taken out under my name and have given Sallie Mae/XXXX enough information as well as new information to come to the obvious conclusion that this loan was taken out without my knowledge or consent ; that the body of the loan belonged to my late father XXXX XXXX. I did defer the loan more than once and contacted an attorney to devise a course of action. A letter was sent by XXXX XXXX XXXX who is a Elder Law/Estate Attorney in RI and has worked on my late father 's estate and under the advice of the Executor XXXX XXXX XXXX that this loan was taken out without my knowledge. In good faith, I did pay some of the loan because I was advised by said attorney to do so. XXXX XXXX ONLY wrote XXXX letter and made XXXX phone call to the XXXX XXXX XXXX office, in which they told him that because the name matches the borrower, then the loan belonged to me.

This letter was in reference to the foreclosure of the property XXXX my former home ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX RI, which I have no legal link.

The additional income is in reference to my late fathers wife XXXX XXXX XXXX and again, she is also the Executor of his estate. There is no other link to my being referenced as "" married '' but in the body of the Sallie Mae/Navient loan. 

Pay stubs have been submitted showing and will prove that I never worked at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, and never made {$100000.00}. In addition I will enclosed proof that my late father worked for XXXX XXXX and never worked for a company listed as XXXX XXXX. My father referenced myself as being married and not he. Also enclosed was a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX my XXXX XXXX which states that she also never knew about this loan and was listed in the loan as a reference. 

I was informed from a Sallie MaeXXXX XXXX representative, XXXX XXXX that the burden of proof that I didnt know was on me. However, considering that this document was obviously falsified ( which is a crime ) and that Sallie MaeXXXX approved a loan that was obviously false leads me to believe that the burden falls on Sallie MaeXXXX to prove that I did know about where the funds for my education came from. That Sallie Mae/XXXX approved on their own an obvious illegal document. My late father XXXX XXXX took care of the finances and so did his wife XXXX XXXX XXXX because she co-signed a loan from XXXX XXXX. I was told before my father passed that I was responsible for ONLY the payment on the last semester of my time at XXXX XXXX and XXXX other loan which XXXX XXXX co signed and I have done so. 

Based on my investigation, I have advised Sallie MaeXXXX that this loan was applied for by my late father, XXXX XXXX XXXX and because of Sallie MaeXXXX XXXX XXXX rules he put me down as the borrower, there was no other option. This loan was obviously his. At this point in time, Sallie MaeXXXX has failed to filed a claim against my late father 's estate ( which is still open ), they also insisted after the XXXX day time frame ( when we called again ) that a letter was sent to the XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX of RI regarding the response to our opposition. In the body of the original document sent, we stated that the attorney was released. I have yet to get a confirmation that that was the case because the attorney refuses to acknowledge that he received the letter.

Sallie Mae received an email from XXXX or more reporting agencies that the stated loan is not mine.

In conclusion, I need Sallie Mae to admit negligence, that they approved a fraudulent and illegal document willingly, that they reverse any disparing marks on my credit reports, that they acknowledge that although the money went to my education, the true owner was my late father ( he insisted that I be kept out of the details of my education 's funding ) and because he passed, it should be forgiven.

"Original loan was with Sallie Mae-It has since been turned over to Navient. 

I am contacting you in hopes that you will be able to help me resolve a very alarming concern I have with Sallie Mae/Navient. In XX/XX/XXXX I attended a University. I graduated from their XXXX program in XX/XX/XXXX and went on to obtain my XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. While enrolled at the university the cost to attend exceeded my financial aid and government loans. According to the college they offered a new loan specifically for XXXX students but I would have to apply directly with Sallie Mae. 

The loan I applied for was to consist of a fixed interest rate of 6.99 %, be able to be consolidated, and/or be repaid by serving in a public service loan forgiveness area. I was advised by Sallie Mae that any payment made early prior to the XX/XX/XXXX start of repayment date was to go directly to principal if documented along with the mailed check. No late fees were to be charged until after the XX/XX/XXXX start date if they occurred. My account history shows I was charged a late fee less than two years after taking out the loan. 

Through the years I have documented on the payment attachment and even sent correspondence letters that my over payments were to be applied to principal yet none were. I was told by Sallie Mae years after having the loan that even with correspondence letters mailed with over payments they would not apply over payments to principal. 

After being approved for this loan and receiving all my documentations I noticed it was not the XXXX loan but a tuition answer loan with variable interest rates. I immediately contacted Sallie Mae and was informed I didnt qualify for the XXXX loan only the Tuition Answer and it could not be changed. I have requested multiple times to have the original promissory note mailed for my record but I have never received that documentation. 

If Sallie Mae had been transparent with their loaning process I NEVER would have agreed to a loan with the terms I have. I feel very strongly this is a company that has taken advantage of young college students. 

The loan amount on XX/XX/XXXX was approved for XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX I have paid Sallie Mae/Navient a total of XXXX and according to their records I still have an unpaid principal amount of XXXX and an unpaid interest balance of XXXX for a total Balance of XXXX without any further accrued interest or variations in my interest rate. 

The interest rate has varied from 9.25-14.5 %. I have contacted them on various occasions to refinance at a fixed rate and get an explanation on the varying rates I was even told during one conversation that they could raise my interest rate to 16.9 %. Not one time was I ever approved, assisted in refinancing or given any explanation on the varying interest rates. 

I have tried everything possible to get out from underneath such a horrible company. I have tried to take out a loan to cover the total, consolidate, refinance, and get approved for the public service loan forgiveness. I dedicated the first 6 years of my career to an under served area and was awarded the XXXX loan repayment program. When I contacted Sallie Mae/Navient for the documentation I needed to use the XXXX loan repayment program I was told if I submitted my Tuition Answer Loan the XXXX application would be denied and my entire application cancelled. 

I chose to work in an underserved area for pay far below the national standard with the benefit of being able to reduce the burden of my student loan debt. I was forced to leave that job to seek employment at a higher rate in attempt to get rid of the financial burden Sallie Mae/Navient has caused. I know I am not alone in this scenario. 

My documentation for my account is still under my maiden name. I have attempted for years to have them change it to my married name. I have requested the name change via phone, fax, and written correspondence. The name change is not a concern I have but I hope it proves to you that I am speaking the truth about this company blatantly refusing to help me every step of the way since taking out this loan. I legally changed my name shortly after taking out the loan in XX/XX/XXXX. 

At this point I feel I have more than covered the amount that was given to me and the remaining balance be forgiven in entirety. 

I truly hope you can help me resolve this issue. I hope that by taking a stand against this company it may reduce the likelihood they continue with their poor business practices.",Student loan

No loan history has been transmitted as of this writing. I still have reason to doubt those figures because the interest due each month is {$1100.00} which would be equal to {$13000.00} for a full year. Without a loan history, I ca n't tell if my payments have been recorded properly. According to my XXXX, XXXX statement, my next payment is not due until XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX yes, XXXX!!! ) and my escrow balance is now approximately {$5600.00} ( which is more than twice than that shown on the cash flow analysis used to compute the adjustment to my monthly escrow payment ). During this time, ASC recorded a monthly escrow fee of {$180.00} and then {$220.00}, even though the monthly escrow was not scheduled to change to {$190.00} until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ( I paid the escrow shortage of {$390.00} ) The escrow cash flow analysis shows that the maximum amount of {$2500.00} will be in XXXX, XXXX which is when the ( {$2200.00} - {$2300.00} ) annual property taxes are due. There is an extra {$3100.00} in this account now. ASC is also not fully applying my extra principle payments, rather the monthly loan statements show funds "" unapplied '' that are not being used in my loan payments. Since XXXX, I submitted monthly payments of {$13000.00} and {$18000.00} and {$13000.00} and {$19000.00} BUT my principal hardly dropped. My required monthly payment is {$1200.00} but the extra payments have not been applied according to normal banking procedures. That is the reason that my interest payments are in error and my loan balance is incorrect.",Mortgage
"I purchased a gift card on XXXX/XXXX/2015 in the amount of {$250.00}. I attempted to use the card in the evening on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and it was declined. I called the customer service number on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and a representative told me that the cashier must have activated the wrong gift card but that she could see the money. I was instructed to fax over some information ( front/back of card, activation receipt, name, phone number, email address, contact time preference ). I did this on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I called back on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to inquire on the status of the fax and was told that it would take 7-10 business days after the fax was received. I asked to escalate the issue and that group informed me that it was n't an activation issue. He said someone had tried to use the card twice in XXXX so when I purchased it in XXXX they decided to not activate it.

I would now need to fax in my address and that the voicemail left on XXXX/XXXX/2015 stated that. I replayed the voicemail to make sure I did n't miss anything. I have been unsuccessful at every attempt made. I feel this is fraudulent and misleading. If the company knows that an attempt has been made to use a gift card prior to it ever being sold, they should not be allowed to take the consumer 's money and have them scrambling trying to recover it.

"XX/XX/XXXX, I received a mail from a debt collecting agency "" Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson , LLP "" ( LGBS ) stating that I owe them a debt of {$150.00} from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). After investigating, I realized that it was a toll charging company. I was skeptical about {$150.00} for a toll. After confirming that I had paid my toll bills, I called LGBS call center stating that I never received a bill from XXXX, and I 'd like some proof that this was n't a scam. After a harassing conversation, the LGBS representative stated that they ca n't give me any info on behalf of XXXX, but said that debt was real and had to be paid. She said if I needed any more info, other than the split for the amount, LGBS was n't the agency responsible to give. So, I called XXXX thereafter. After a polite conversation with the customer representative, I told them that all my toll bills were paid in full. However, XXXX representative insisted that they had sent me four separate mails. Since I had requested for paperless bills, I informed them that this had to be a mistake. The XXXX representative later confirmed my charges and informed that since I had changed my vehicle registration ( Moving from XXXX to XXXX ), a new account had been created, and the bill was automatically sent to the residence due to the lack of email id. Being an international student, and visiting home country for months, I do lose mail. So, with the XXXX representative 's help, I tracked the mail from the post office and confirmed that it was indeed my toll bill dating back to XXXX XXXX. There were XXXX toll charges each with regular toll fee, process fee, late fee and mailing fee totaling to {$35.00} sent on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I informed the XXXX representative that this is only one fourth of the amount I am being asked to pay. She informed that she has no control over the amount once it goes to the collection agency. 
I called back LGBS and informed them how can the fee be so high. As before the representative was very rude, and informed me that this is the fee and I have to pay it. I asked the representative the procedure to obtain a split for the fee. I asked her if I delay my payments any further would they charge me additional fee. The representative stated and I quote- "" How would I know. If XXXX asks more, you pay more, if they say the same you pay the same. I am not responsible for your payment, I am here to collect it.

"In XXXX XXXX, we completed a mortgage refinance with Bank of America. The major feature of the refinance that we insisted upon was no Escrow Account for the XXXX Property Taxes or Property Insurance. We were going to make the payments directly to XXXX Real Estate Taxes and Home Owners Insurance.

Presently, we paid in full the XXXX Real Estate Property Taxes for the period of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

Our credit union is starting to see issues with multiple retailers that use Certegy 's services because our member 's checks are being declined.

"I began my mortgage refinance on XX/XX/XXXX with HSBC. At the time my mortgage balance was {$270000.00}. My XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$2500.00} had not factored in and so the HSBC representative initiated the refinance paperwork with the XX/XX/XXXX balance of {$270000.00}. 
The following month HSBC had XXXX service the loan. This added a third party to the process and caused delays that resulted in my interest rate of 2.94 % extended twice since the delays were not my fault. 
For the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I made 4 payments of {$2400.00}. ( I stopped making the extra payments towards the principal during the refinance process. ) In total I made 5 payments totaling {$12000.00} before closing on my refinance on XX/XX/XXXX. This brought down my balance to {$270000.00}. When the HSBC representative called me to inform me of my closing date, I realized I was n't supposed to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment. He said I would have my XX/XX/XXXX payment refunded. 
When XXXX mailed me a "" Payoff Refund '' check in the amount of XXXX, which arrived on XX/XX/XXXX, I realized this amount was roughly the difference between the starting balance ( XXXX ) and the closing date balance ( {$270000.00} ). I understand that based on the amortization schedule the 5 payments totaling {$12000.00} would only cause the balance to drop by {$3800.00}. I do n't have an issue with that. 
However, to keep the loan at {$270000.00} requires that I make an additional {$12000.00} in paymentsto bring down the balance to what it was on my closing date.

I have immediately sent them any papers they requested. The only thing that I was late on was my income tax.

Loan Amount : {$240000.00} P & I - {$110000.00} Hazard Insurance - {$88.00} Flood Insurance : {$160.00} Total Monthly Payment : {$1600.00} Carrington lowered the Escrow Payment for a couple months so our overall monthly payment was XXXX, Then in XX/XX/XXXX, they readjusted it to {$1800.00}.

She said she already had that. I told her I would provide my social to the American I was transferred to. She refused to transfer me. A day or two later, Carrington showed up on my caller ID.

Yes Step 3 What happened? 
Recently my FICO Score dropped significantly. XXXX XXXX referred me to XXXX and they explained that the negative data is reported by the XXXX XXXX Bank, an affiliate bank under the United Bankshares Holdings. Since our mortgage account was serviced by the XXXX bank ( bankingwithunited ) another affiliate of the United Bankshares Holdings, I think that a lack of information synchronization among the sister banks has caused the problem. Indeed, our mortgage account with the XXXX  bank was paid off in XX/XX/2016, the bank later sold our property to another mortgagor for 30 % higher price, but continued to charge our account for additional mortgages almost a year after they bought our property for the value of the balance, but did not release the loan from obligation. This all is a banking irregularity, which should not be affecting the customer. In this case, it seems the XXXX  bank got the property at the reduced price ( mortgage balance ), sold for a higher price ( made a profit ) but still wants to collect mortgages from the owner whose property was extorted. Not a respectable thing to do, but it is happening now. Maybe no, but the whole situation must be resolved. CFPB may help. 


I want the CFPB to publish this description on consumerfinance.gov so that others can learn from my experience. 

The CFPB will take steps to remove my personal information from this description but someone may still be able to identify me. Learn how it works. I consent to publishing this description after the CFPB has taken these steps.

My solid personal credit history along with the testimonial/history of my company with verifiable data to demonstrate the scope of my business is *significantly* enough data to get approved for the XXXX limit I requested. Considering that I have total combined home equity of XXXX, the level of risk for the bank is non-existent.

"XXXX XXXX, XXXX Freedom Mortgage is not applying principal only payments to my mortgage balance. My mortgage was sold to Freedom Mortgage ( FM ) XXXX XXXX. The beginning Mortgage balance was {$120000.00} when FM obtained the mortgage. 
Phone call to Freedom Mortgage Sat XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Issue - Principal only payments had not been applied to the principal. 
A FM representative gave me some options, one option was to return my principal only payments. The options offered were unacceptable and I asked to be transferred to a manager. Instead of reaching a manager, I was transferred to XXXX in the Escalations Department. She was not helpful and often interrupted. I explained the principal only payments I made were not applied to the principal only. Those principal only payments were sent from XXXX XXXX XXXX bill pay in the amounts of {$3000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX, {$2000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX and {$1000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX. I stated FM had given me the principal only payment address to send online Principal only payments from my XXXX XXXX XXXX bill pay. I informed XXXX, I called back and spoke with a second FM representative to double check the address to ensure it was correct. XXXX said she had never heard of that address. I said it was not logical that XXXX FM reps had given me the same address and the payments were going to FM ; one was applied to the principal only. She asked if there was anything else she could do for me. I responded yes ; however, she hung up on me. 
The other issue was the a Monthly auto draft which I had set up with F M as an auto draft in XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$1200.00} with regular P & I payments of {$1100.00} and {$100.00} principal only. I established auto draft to ensure all payments would be correctly and timely processed. This also was incorrectly done for the XXXX XXXX XXXX payment. 
The regular Monthly XXXX XXXX house payment had not been applied. On XXXX XXXX FM incorrectly paid {$1000.00} to Principal, {$100.00} to Principal and {$130.00} to P & I and resulting in the house payment of {$1100.00} not applied. I was not able to address this since XXXX hung up on me. I called back and asked for a Supervisor. I was told I would receive a return call from a Supervisor. 
Monday XXXX XXXX, I received the return call. I went over each principal payment incorrectly applied and asked they be correctly applied on the dates I had specified and not on a later date, to avoid paying more interest than necessary. 
Those principal only payments were sent from XXXX XXXX XXXX bill pay in the amounts of {$3000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX, {$2000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX and {$1000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX. 
I informed the FM supervisor the auto draft XXXX XXXX XXXX incorrectly paid {$1000.00} to Principal and {$130.00} to P and I ; making an incomplete house payment to P & I and applied {$100.00} to Principal. I informed him the Monthly paper statements I receive do not match the Loan Overview online. Example the statement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX shows payment due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the loan overview online shows the next payment due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Both do not reflect payments posted properly. 
I asked to be sent an amortized itemized listing with corrections showing the beginning balance, date of regular payments and all additional principal only payments reflecting the running balance.

"For the record before I begin the actual complaint I want to make it known that this is XXXX XXXX the actual human being and living soul that is making this complaint. The previous complaint I filed against EQUIFAX on XX/XX/XXXX CASE- XXXX, EQUIFAX falsely assumed for no valid reason and chose not to respond by claiming that the complaint may have been filed by a credit repair company, which was completely false. Again this is XXXX XXXX filing this complaint and no other entity or parties are involved. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a notarized letter to EQUIFAX disputing several items ; it was received by EQUIFAX onXX/XX/XXXX. In this correspondence I also attached a police report for several education loans that are being falsely reported on my credit file. I was very specific in my correspondence that this police report was for those specific items which would include XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ; the police report was n't for every item I disputed in my correspondence. The police report was only for these specific items ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as stated in my correspondence datedXX/XX/XXXX. I received a correspondence from EQUIFAX dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that EQUIFAX, at this time, will not block the information subject to the submitted identity theft and/or police report. EQUIFAX provided no reason nor did EQUIFAX cite a law for this action. According to FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ), a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. EQUIFAX has decided to disregard this section of the FCRA. Also, in regards to the items I have disputed that were not included in the police report that need to be properly and lawfully verified, which I have requested from EQUIFAX several times, with no compliance on the part of EQUIFAX. I have requested their method of verification and EQUIFAX has not complied and has admitted through their actions and agents that the verification process is automated and electronic codes are sent between the credit bureau and alleged creditors and/or data furnishers, which are not properly or lawfully verifying any accounts/items. The definition of verify in a XXXX 's Law Dictionary is stated and defined as the following : "" To confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit ; to show to be true. Particularly used of making formal oath to accounts, petitions, pleadings, and other papers. The word "" verified '' when used in statute, ordinarily imports a verity attested by the sanctity of an oath. It is used interchangeably with sworn. To prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to check or test the accuracy or exactness of ; to confirm or establish the authenticity of ; to authenticate ; to maintain ; to affirm ; to support ; second ; back as a friend. XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ''. EQUIFAX is admittedly not verifying items/accounts according to this definition from the XXXX law dictionary. For an item to be properly, legally and lawfully verified ; the alleged creditor/data furnisher must "" confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit '' that means that a living human being and authorized representative of the alleged creditor and/or data furnisher must attest under oath that a debt is actually owed and that the information they are reporting to the credit bureau is completely true and completely correct. This does not occur by sending electronic codes between the credit bureau and alleged creditor and/or data furnisher.

"I have been depositing checks with BB & T and every time I do so, the XXXX, Kentucky branch of BB & T puts an extended hold on my check deposits. The branch located in XXXX, Kentucky at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, KY XXXX, continues to put extended holds on each of my check deposits in violation of the Expedited Funds Availability Act. I deposited a {$700.00} check on XX/XX/XXXX using the ATM at the branch in XXXX, Kentucky, and made another deposit on XX/XX/XXXX for two checks {$700.00} and {$1300.00}. The {$700.00} deposit that I made on XX/XX/XXXX, the branch did not release those funds until XX/XX/XXXX. The BB & T branch put an excessive hold on the XX/XX/XXXX deposit for {$700.00} for no reason other than because it was for more than "" {$500.00} '' dollars. 

I spoke with a person named XXXX from the BB & T branch in XXXX, Kentucky on XX/XX/XXXX, who couldn't explain why they were putting excessive check deposit holds on my account. She called me on XX/XX/XXXX and said that on XX/XX/XXXX, they were releasing {$100.00} from the check deposits of {$700.00} and {$1300.00} that were made on XX/XX/XXXX, {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and the remainder XX/XX/XXXX. She then said that they were placing the excessive holds to make sure that the checks would clear, when there was no reason to assume they wouldn't. One of the checks was from XXXX XXXX. The BB & T branch in XXXX, Kentucky is violating the Expedited Funds Availability Act by placing excessive check deposit holds on my account. The BB & T branch is engaging in unfair business practices with their excessive holds on my check deposits. When asked they can't explain why they are placing excessive holds. The XXXX, Kentucky BB & T branch employees gave me the runaround as to why they are placing excessive holds on my check deposits. First they said it was because the deposits were for more than {$500.00}, then they said that it was because the account was less than a year old, neither of those are reasons under the Expedited Funds Availability Act to place excessive holds on my check deposits.",Bank / Checking / Savings

"To whom it may concern, My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I applied for a CitiBank Citi XXXX credit card using the promotion code provided in a letter they sent me ( attached ) in mail, which stated that I am pre-approved for Citi XXXX  credit card.

I am an XXXX  citizen currently in the US on valid student status ( XXXX status ), so I do not have either of these documents. So I called Citi customer support and they initially wouldnt tell me why they can not process my application. 

At first they said that either on the application form or on their website the immigration/citizenship requirements are mentioned, but they retracted that statement because it simply was not there. Neither in the promotion letter, nor the application webpage ( both attached ) was there a mention of requirements regarding nationality or immigration status. 

They eventually told me that I am not qualified for this credit card because I am an XXXX national and federal law prohibits them from issuing me this credit card and my application will be rejected. However, they would not tell me what rule/law they are referring to. I reminded them that on the back of the letter they had sent me it is mentioned that The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age. 

Their failure to disclose this information had the following consequences for me. First, I shared sensitive information including my SSN, my address and date of birth with this financial institution, expecting that I will receive a service in return, however, according to their oral statement ( which they could not point to a written counterpart anywhere on their website or their letters ), I was not qualified for in the first place. Second, the fact that I would my credit card application will be denied is probably impact m

In Summary of the complaint : In the Month of XX/XX/XXXX I made two payments to American Express for the amount of {$3700.00} and their records have not credited me for one payment. It is found that the payment of {$3700.00} was moved to an interest pay overtime account., so now Im paying interest for money I payed to American Express in addition to them stating I owe {$3700.00}.

I asked for one payment of {$3700.00} to be refunded back to me, and it was refunded, but their processing of this refund seems to be placed in their pay over time account, so I am now paying for monies on the refund and this is an accounting error on the American Express side. This error can be clearly shown in the American Express provided XXXX  which is the accounting ledger file and if you compare the numbers amounts to that of the statements we see inaccuracy.

1 ) The issue complaint Equifax to remove XXXX from my credit reporting just like Equifax removed other creditors from my bankruptcy Chapter XXXX. 
2 ) I did not had to contact my other creditors to have items removed from my bankruptcy, however, Equifax did removed other creditors that was associated with my bankruptcy.

State Farm Bank told me on 2 different occasions that it was not their responsibility to get that title. So my son was paying on a vehicle that still belonged to the previous owner because State Farm Bank did n't feel it was their responsibility to receive a title when funds were released ; therefore funds were stolen by the car lot owners. I had to pay for a couple of temporary plates while issue was resolved because my son needed the vehicle to go to school. Then i also had to pay for county fees, again when the title was finally transferred to our name.

"Hunter Warfield is a debt collector that purchased a debt from XXXX, an apartment complex in XXXX. In XX/XX/2016, they fraudulently placed a collection account on my credit reports. Upon obtaining the account documentation from Hunter Warfield, it was clear that the account was fraudulent, and not only did I not ever owe XXXX ( and accordingly Hunter Warfield ) any money, they actually owed me money. However, my attorney made Hunter Warfield an offer of settlement - remove the collection from my credit reports, and I would not pursue recovery of the funds owed to me ( plus attorneys ' fees ). 

Although Hunter Warfield never responded to my attorney 's numerous emails and calls, they did remove the account from my credit report. Now, more than 6 months later, they have re-reported the same debt, which they know to be both fraudulent and non-collectible.

Both organizations failed to respond in a timely manners with accurate information to my requests or to the requests made to each other resulting in an erroneous accrual of interest and continued damage to my credit rating.

I was listed, along with my sister, as joint in the event that my mother needed emergency funds and was unable to access them for any reason. After multiple phone calls back and forth between myself, Wells Fargo, and XXXX as I attempted to have the illegally seized funds returned to my mother without success I made an agreement with my mother to pay her back.

"Step 1 : What is this complaint about? 

XXXX XXXX has sent inaccurate tradeline information to XXXX about my credit card four times in XX/XX/XXXX.

I want the inaccurate tradeline information removed, and have contacted customer service at CITIBANK CBNA and XXXX to alert them that the information is inaccurate, and I want it removed.

Step 2 : What type of problem are you having? 

My credit report is continuously monitored by the XXXX XXXX  service by XXXX. I have received four emails in XX/XX/XXXX notifying me about changes to my credit report, made by XXXX XXXX. The changes to my tradeline that have been reported to me are inaccurate.

Step 3 : What happened? 

On XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018, XXXX XXXX reported to XXXX that my account had been Affected by natural or declared disaster. 
This is wrong. I have not been affected by natural or declared disasters, and I did not make any such report, ever. I know of no natural or declared disasters in my surrounding area. 
On XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018, XXXX XXXX reported to XXXX that Consumer disputes after resolution. 
This is wrong. I did not make any consumer dispute on my XXXX XXXX account in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/2018 at all. I paid my accounts on time in each case, without making any kind of dispute. 

Step 4 : What company is this complaint about?

This complaint is about XXXX XXXX customer service and XXXX  XXXX XXXX Customer Care. 
I contacted the XXXX XXXX Customer Care Team at XXXX on XX/XX/2018 to report the inaccurate tradeline update made to my credit report by XXXX XXXX. XXXX    TrustedID Premier Customer Care Team told me there was nothing they could do, and I should call XXXX   XXXX. 
I called XXXX  XXXX  customer service ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/2018, and described the problem to them. They said they would clear up the inaccurate information and remove it from my credit report. 
On XX/XX/2018 I received a letter from XXXX XXXX saying they corrected the issue. However, they did not. The inaccurate information has remained on my credit report, and they have added more incorrect information each month of XX/XX/XXXX. 
In addition, the correction CITIBANK CBNA claimed to have put in place was in itself inaccurate. They said my account was no longer in dispute. That was not trueit was never in dispute in the first place. 
When I received information about more inaccurate updated tradeline reports being made to my credit report by CITIBANK CBNA, I called their customer service line again on XX/XX/2018 to complain about the inaccurate information they keep reporting to XXXX. 
Once again, CITIBANK CBNA did nothing to correct the situation.

"Today, Thursday, XXXX XXXX 2015, I received an e-mail confirmation from you at Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, saying Trans Union sent a response to my complaint. Unfortunately, since the same date the complaint was submitted, last Saturday, XXXX XXXX 2015, I am unable to register or set a new password, no matter all the times I tried to do this, even with the help over the phone of CFPB representatives several times, so I am unable to see the written response by myself, but a female representative at around XXXX XXXX XXXX today, XXXX XXXX 2015, was able to read for me Trans Union 's response over the phone.

The lady who read over the phone for me the Trans Union 's response, said nothing about what I am asking in this complaint to Trans Union. Simply what she told over the phone, and you can read the exact transcript of it by searching the company response that I am still unable to see here at CFPB, Trans Union just says that there are different score models, that they use the XXXX Score, not the XXXX XXXX XXXX, or FICO model, but all those things are available at their web sites for anyone who wish to see it, that is not my complaint at all, to summarize it again, Trans Union says that FICO should receive the updated and corrected report Trans Union sent me after they ended their investigation, and with that, Trans Union says FICO should update my credit report, in this case my FICO version of Trans Union, the only XXXX showing the terrible error of a missing payment to a XXXX, no matter the letter received from XXXX XXXX recognizes this error, and all the other documents previously submitted which will be submitted again, with additional documents too. FICO disagrees with Trans Union, saying through their representatives over the phone that Trans Union has to send them, FICO, the updated report or corrections they found on their investigation. FICO says is not that I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, have to send FICO the corrected Trans Union credit report after an investigation because of my complain to Trans Union, that is the reason of my complaint, because the FICO version of my Trans Union still shows the error, and Trans Union does not want to follow the procedure FICO says, and FICO does not want to receive my updated credit report received on the mail days ago, from Trans Union, so my FICO version of my credit report from Trans Union remains unfairly damaged, no matter all the evidence showing is unfair, and the FICO version of Trans Union is the XXXX used to approve or deny, or even limit credit applications, or existing credit, so is unfair from all angles. I am starting to think about the possibility of something else. Is Trans Union forced to pay to FICO, if they send the corrections of my report to FICO? Then, is that the real reason why Trans Union does not want to do that, no matter it is the recognized procedure? The error was originated at XXXX XXXX, the company which was previously administrating this XXXX XXXX, and no matter is not show on the current Trans Union credit report, it does show at the FICO version of my Trans Union credit report. The response Trans Union sent, according to what was read to me over the phone, does not answer any of my questions and complaints included, I ca n't include the response attached here, but you have the case number so you can easily see it and send it to Trans Union, along with this XXXX, in which I dispute and disagree with Trans Union 's response to this case.

"Dear Sir/Madame, Approximately 2 years ago, I became victim of identity theft. Someone was using my SSN to open credit card accounts. I was informed by more than XXXX bank that he/she provides a misspelled version of my last name. He/She does not have my correct address nor my correct phone number. The fraud was detected with no further incident. Around XX/XX/XXXX of last year, I received a call from a collection agency. I was informed that Synchrony Bank had opened a TJX account under the mispelled version of my last name. I clarified everything with the collection agency. I clarified everything with Synchrony Bank. However, I was disappointed in Synchrony Bank for granting a credit card account to someone using my last name incorrectly and for not notifying me all along that I would be put in collection. I chose to forget and forgive on condition that any account previously opened under the same circumstances with Synchrony Bank be closed immediately. ( I need perfect credit history as I am ready to request a 30 year mortgage. ) Last week I generated XXXX credit reports : my credit score was tarnished by a collection claim due to unpaid balances from a JCPenny credit card opened through Synchrony Bank. Once again, the account was opened under an incorrect version of my last name ( as was the TJX account ). I contacted Synchrony Bank to ask for an immediate resolution and for clarifications. I was informed that if my last name is just slightly misspelled, the Bank can open an account solely based on SSN without the need to reach out to the prospective client. I was informed that the Bank tried to reach me by mail and by phone. The mail was returned to them. The phone number was incorrect. Still, I was reported to a collection agency twice. Now, please consider the following : - Since last year, I spent a huge amount of time on the phone with Collection Agencies, Consumer Reporting Agencies, and Synchrony Bank to clarify the issues. 
- I have been trying to start a mortgage. Until my credit history reflects my true self ( I was never late in any payment ), I wo n't get the best interest rates. Synchrony Bank informed me it may take an additional 2-3 months before my credit standing is correctly restored. 
- As I look at my credit report, there have been 53 requests to check my credit history mostly from credit card companies. When I filed a police report last week, it was suggested I should change SSN. If the identity thief may have been disheartened by the fact that all of his/her attempts were rejected because the information was extremely inconsistent, he/she wo n't stop trying, knowing that there is a bank out there that will open an account even if my information is incorrect. 
- The whole incident could have been avoided if Synchrony Bank had at least taken the time to contact me when so many signs were revealing a suspicious situation. They did contact me indeed when my bills were not paid ( to no avail because the phone number was incorrect ). Still, they put me through the "" ordeal '' of collection. 
I have to 2 sets of questions for you. I would be extremely grateful if you could address them or somehow offer some guidance. 
- Can a Bank act so negligently and lightly to the expense of innocent victims of fraud? Can a bank open an account based on a SSN ( despite non-matching last name, address and phone number )? Twice? 
- On a personal note, this incident has cost me a lot of time, the loss of potential financial investments and distress ( I feel like I am only half way through. ) What is the best way to hold the bank accountable for their negligence? I am not sure I am ready to contact a lawyer if there is any swift and less stressful solution. However, I will do whatever is required to get personal justice and prevent other people from going through the same experience. Please advise. Thanks for your attention.",Credit / Prepaid card

"Dear Sirs : I have just started a new job with XXXX XXXX as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My very first pay check starting this new job and I mean the whole paycheck from this work for the month of XX/XX/2018 has been taken and I mean all 100 % of it as a payment to Texas Guaranteed student loan! 

Ive made payments to them in past sizable amount to no avail ore even a dent ever made to the principal. They are an out of touch and carelessly, corrupt and unregulated because their interest rates are not realistic to student abilities to ever catchup and depend on small payments to sustain and prolong the misery to students. 

Also corrupt is the Treasury Dept willingly giving my entire paycheck to the pigs at Texas Guaranteed. The latter literally refers to 100 % without any warning or rule or regulation making it a reasonable percentage portion, but instead all of it was taken. Is there no percentages that limit amounts? How can it be the total earnings? Where is tax payers government when needed if our very Federal Treasury Department is doing this for rich corporations intoxicated by anything goes tactics?

I have bill realities to contend and attend to and one of them is insufficient funds and accumulating charges versus income and an appropriate balance to be kept. One of them is my son going to college himself this spring. 

The whole check of a months worth of work is gone without notice of its being taken or even a 40 % amount would have been impactful, consequential and resonable enough but the whole paycheck? 

Why has the federal government allowed this to be carried out as such? Versus a reasonable and understandable amount? The latter is counterproductive to domestic down to earth income and survival. Why did the federal government take a full income and feed it to a loan corporation in its entirety? Why was I mistreated to a 100 % garnishment? Is it some kind of a backwards lesson to an already vulnerable poor and lower class prejudice that clouds financial realities? Why do the treasury carry this out for a corporation when they could have taken a portion?

"In an effort to establish an individual line of credit for my wife, we decided to obtain a credit card in her name.

"This complaint concerns a USAA Credit Card. 

First attempt to pay off the card : XXXX, XXXX ( check never cashed ) Date payment returned with letter : XXXX XXXX, XXXX Date second payment was sent by title company : XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( check never cashed ) Date third payment was sent by title company : XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( check never cashed ) Date wire transfer was submitted : XXXX XXXX, XXXX The total amount of interest and late fees I have asked to be reimbursed based on their letter is {$560.00}. They denied my request on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

In order to pay off the credit card, I refinanced a property. When I sent the check to USAA for the full balance, they returned it approximately 25 days later with a letter stating that they were unable to process my payment since the account number was not on the check and charged me late fees for the month of XXXX. The letter stated that if I re-submitted the check with the letter and first and last 4 digits of the account number, I would be credited with the date of the original payment and would not incur late fees or interest.
The title company sent another check, with the account number AND a stub from the paper statement. Approximately 30 days later, the account had still not been credited. I called USAA and they bounced me around to different people since the account had been closed by the other joint owner. After 30 minutes of speaking with different people and explaining the situation, they put me on hold for another 10 minutes after which I was disconnected. 
I called the title company again who stated that they often have problems with getting USAA to accept payments. They cancelled the second check, issued a third check, submitted it with the statement stub again, and included the appropriate account numbers. 
Another month passed, with interest accruing, and the account was still not credited with the payment. I called USAA again, and again, they claim they did not receive the payment, bounced me around to several people and departments, and eventually put me on hold and I was disconnected after 30 minutes on the phone.
I called USAA the next day to ask if could wire money to the account and they said I could n't. I also asked if their customer records showed I had been trying to pay off the card for almost five months and they said they only have records of me calling, but that was it- no content. I finally dug through their website and found the wiring instructions that supposedly did not exist for "" that type of account '' and found them. The money was wired the next day and the account was paid off. I continued to make payments and was charged interest the entire time. Including late fees, which were incurred during the months the checks were sent to USAA but not cashed, the total was {$560.00}. 
I then contacted USAA twice more to obtain a refund for the interest and late fees incurred during the last 4 months but they refuse to reimburse me for them, despite their letter.

That night I spoke with XXXX different people at Bank of America and a duplicate claim was initiated although, I explained that a claim had already been initiated by the first person I spoke with. The duplicate claim caused my account to be credited twice. Bank of America allowed the fraudulent charges to be debited to my account.

They said that a duplicate card was not used that it had to be the original card that was used and there was no way that anyone could have gotten my debit card number and pin number unless I had given my pin number. I was told that there was no way anyone could have known how much money was in the account unless I told them.

Hi XXXX, You have an extenuating circumstance loan. We always want the extenuating circumstance to be approved by the underwriters BEFORE we issue a prequalification letter. If you want to ask XXXX if they will write an extenuating circumstance loan prequalification letter before seeing documents please do so. But they dont even write loans for credit scores under 600. 

The only reason I will EVER ask for anything is so we can write the loan. If you are really serious about buying a home then this is what we require for documentation. I will never ask for unnecessary documents.

"Home equity line of credit application # XXXX with Wells Fargo On XX/XX/XXXX, I  submitted the application for home equality line of credit ( application # XXXX ) in the local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX. Two weeks after the application submission, I received an email asking for more documents. I didnt understand several of the items on the list, so I tried calling the number on the email, trying to get an explanation. However, after many attempts of calls and voicemails, I did get any response. I even asked the local banker to help explain such terms as acknowledgment of residual income and most current statement verification ; but even the banker himself could not explain. I finally got an opportunity and spoke with my loan application processor, and submitted all the documents she asked for on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted more documents via email and also explained that I would be out of country from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, and not able to answer phone call or check email frequently, if there are any additional documents needed, I will submit it on XX/XX/XXXX when I return home. However, they emailed me a denial notice on XX/XX/XXXX when I was still out of country. The two reasons for denial are : 1 ) amounts owned are too high relative to your income, 2 ) income stated on the application can not be verified. <P/>I was unfairly untreated in the process of applying for the home equality line of credit with Wells Fargo for two the following reasons : 1. I was not given clear instruction on what kinds of documents. They used the jargons that even their own bankers could not explain. They repeatedly ignored customers requests for clarificationthey ignored my emails, ignored my phone call and voicemailssee attached email exchange. Such arrogant and negligence of customers was unacceptable. <P/>2. Their denial reasons were not unfounded. 1 ) For the first reason, amounts owned are too high relative to your income. I have sufficient income and limited debt, the home equality line of credit I applied for was only $ XXXX for 10 years ; the monthly payment is less than {$250.00}. My monthly income is {$10000.00}, plus {$3200.00} rental income, plus personal investment and savings of more than {$20000.00}. My debt is limited, my income is more than enough to make this monthly payment. Plus, my credit score provided by WF is XXXX. <P/>2 ) For the second reason income stated on the application can not be verified. I have submitted my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, tax returns of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, monthly pay stubs, and bank statements. I am a tenured XXXX at XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX University, as a XXXX XXXX employee, my yearly salary is published online. In addition to the salary of my job, I also submitted statements of my personal investment and leases of my two rental properties as additional income. If these are not sufficient verification of income, I like to know what kind of verification they need. <P/>To conclude, my experience with applying for home equality line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank was very negative. I was treated unfairly. I would like an investigation on whether the denial of my application was based on my gender, race, and country of origin. <P/>Enclosed : List of documents submitted for this application",Mortgage

"On XXXX XXXX, ( 22 days after submitting my most recent payment ) I visited the FedLoan Servicing website to monitor my student loan.

There was n't ( and today, still is n't ) any correspondence indicating why the interest on my accounts increased {$58.00}. On the morning of XXXX XXXX at XXXX, I contacted FedLoan Servicing and spoke with XXXX , ID # XXXX for 72 minutes. During this time, I was provided with inaccurate reasonings as to why the interest may have been capitalized. Finally, XXXX stated that she will request for a review to be completed on my account to determine why the principal amount increased. I asked XXXX that I be contacted once there was additional information and she stated that this would occur. On XXXX XXXX at XXXX, I contacted FedLoan Servicing again to inquire about any updates on my account. I spoke with XXXX, ID # XXXX for 14 minutes. XXXX stated that my account was still being reviewed but she offered to look at my account to determine if she can assess why the capitalization may have occurred. XXXX indicated to me that there was no reasoning for the increase in my principal amount, based on her independent review. XXXX stated that she would leave the "" review '' status on my account. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX again and was informed by worker ( I did not record name and ID, unfortunately ) that the review status on my account was removed with a note to inform borrower, ( myself ) if called that interest was capitalized because application submitted was to have payment recalculated, as opposed to re-certified as intended. I did not accept this response because I knew it was inaccurate and requested to be transferred to a supervisor. I spoke to the supervisor XXXX, ID # XXXX for over 30 minutes. XXXX initially stated that he did not understand why interest was being capitalized on my account as I re-certified my Income Based Repayment Plan which had not changed, in addition to my making large payments to satisfy the accrued interest on my account. XXXX later indicated that I was being charged interest from XXXX 2016. When I asked XXXX to explain why, he could not. I requested that my account be adjusted, but he refused stating that it will go into review. 

I am communicating this complaint at this time because I do not trust the worker/supervisor at FedLoan Servicing. I was told on XXXX XXXX and XXXX that my account was being reviewed. On XXXX XXXX, I was informed that it was no longer in review ( I was never contacted ) but a note on my account stated to inform me of information that was inaccurate ( explained above ). 

In the year of 2016, I paid off {$32000.00}. I have been working several jobs to afford to make such payments on my account. I no longer wish to burdened by this loan and the constant monitoring of my account in fear being taken advantage of. It is an insult to increase my loan amount, for no apparent reason, especially while I am working hard to eradicate this debt. 

In conclusion, my principal amount was increased and none of the workers at FedLoan has been able to provide an appropriate explanation as to why this occurred. Most importantly, my account is not being adjusted.",Student loan
On XX/XX/18 I applied for a XXXX XXXX credit card on line through XXXX XXXX.

Inquired about options available and what I can do. Representative said I can do a "" Voluntary Surrender '' Rep. said they pick up the car, sell at auction, $ from sale will go towards my balance. If it pays off my loan then I don't owe them, if the sale does not pay the balance I am responsible for it. I agreed to this option, as there were no other options provided to me by the rep. Furthermore the rep. asked me if the co-owner that is also on the auto loan contract agree with the "" Voluntary Surrender '' I said yes ( rep. never asked to speak to the co-owner ) Rep. also explained that they will be calling me the following weak to arrange to have the car picked up! 
I called back a couple of hours later to make sure that the automatic payment was stopped since I was giving back the car. The rep. that answered said no it hadn't been canceled but that she would cancel it. I also asked if it was set in their system for my car to be picked up and she said "" yes ''. 
XX/XX/XXXX I went to my car to clean in out but, the car was gone! I proceeded to call Credit Acceptance but they were closed however, there was a recording saying "" if your car has been repossessed and you want to make a payment '' I now realized that this solution was a very bad solution. Monday was a holiday and they were closed.

However, nothing was resolved between this phone call and the 3 different reps. 
I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and filed a complaint ID XXXX. I received a response via the USPS mail approximately 7 days later dated XX/XX/XXXX.

DID NOT ask to speak to co-owner of vehicle. Rep. asked me if co-owner agrees with the surrender I said yes However, co-owner does not.

3. Rep. said that someone will be calling next weak to arrange to pick up car. Car was towed on XX/XX/2018. There were NO MISSED CALLS on my phone nor does my phone call records reflect any incoming calls. Moreover the letter from Credit Acceptance states that the tow company tried to contact me and this is simply not true.

"Hello y'all : I live in XXXX , Georgia . And I signed up and received a credit card from Chase ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) who is a premium credit card with a annual fee of {$450.00} per year, with the benefit of having some benefits out of it. 

One of the peeks when I signed up was the Purchase Protection ( meaning that if I had bought something with the credit card and the item ( s ) got stolen, I could claim under certain conditions ) I could ask for the insurance company ( Credit Card Service ) to repair/repay for those purchases made using my credit card. 

Well, I started doing my XXXX degree in XXXX XXXX and I made the purchases that I needed for my classes using my credit card the first week of XX/XX/2018 using that credit card.

Well they declined because out of all the receipts, there is one for {$400.00} that they couldn't verify ( An XXXX receipt that instead of being some electronic thing, it was some groceries, still on my name but enough for them to decline it ). 

I asked them not to honor the electronic device and move forward to the other already verified receipts. They declined.

"Made monthly online-pymts to Fortiva- paid the said amount per the webpage. Fortiva reporting to credit bureaus as late- no help with correcting. I opened up an account ( Account # XXXX ) with Fortiva in XXXX with a credit limit of {$1500.00}. In late XXXX XXXX, I received my credit reports and I noticed Fortiva reported me late to the credit bureaus several times in XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX -30 days late XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX -60 days late XXXX XXXX -90 days late I knew this could n't be correct because I paid at least the monthly minimum amount of what the statement said via the online website.

There was n't a payment made in XXXX XXXX because the online payment site stated the next payment of {$100.00} ( minimum ) was due on XXXX XXXX XXXX. I understood that this account is an installment account that fluctuates up/down monthly depending on your balance. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed Fortiva XXXX certified letters ( XXXX to the CEO/Director and XXXX to Corporate Dispute Center ) to include my compliant, online screenshots of my account statements showing what to pay and payments made. I also filed a complaint with the XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, I received a XXXX page, XXXX sentence letter from Fortiva thanking me for being a valued customer but after a review of my account the reporting 's are accurate and no error has been found on their part, but feel free to call customer service if I have any other questions. No signature or a person 's name was on the letter. Talk about HORRIBLE customer service! They blew me off, as they do when I call customer service. I was expecting a history of receipts from Fortiva showing my full payment history, all transactions dealing with the account, a typed, signed-response and a courtesy statement saying as a 1x courtesy the credit reports will be updated due to all past errors and my experience to say the least. Fortiva did respond back to the XXXX on XXXX XXXX and they stated that they credited my account {$100.00} in late fees but declined to update my credit report as paid on time. 
I advised the XXXX that I did not accept the response and I wanted my credit report updated correctly because of Fortiva ' s website error. The only option to make payments on your account is mail, online or over the phone. You do n't have the option to go inside a store and make your payments, so being that this account is a revolving account, how was I to know that the minimum amount online was n't correct? 
Fortiva responded on XXXX XXXX with a breakdown of my account history ( which is n't available online ). Also declining to correct my credit report. 
XXXX information attached* To prove my point I have attached XXXX statement screenshots ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) that I was able to save. Fortiva mentioned in their statement that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a statement generated for a min of {$360.00} due. Fortiva reported me to the credit bureaus as 90 days late as of XXXX XXXX. However my online screenshot DATED : XXXX XXXX XXXX, shows XXXX {$100.00} due XXXX XXXX XXXX with no past due outstanding. Fortiva stated in the XXXX response that a statement generated on XXXX XXXX stating a MIN of {$120.00} was owed in XXXX, I paid {$180.00} in total ( {$86.00} XXXX XXXX and {$100.00} - XXXX XXXX ). They then stated I owed {$21.00} for XXXX but my online screenshot shows {$0.00} due for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I did n't make a payment in XXXX because it said {$0.00} due online. 
Also, the online system does n't update in real-time even after you make a payment. To prove my point I have attached a before and after screenshot for XXXX statement which states {$42.00} due by XXXX XXXX. Just paid {$21.00} on today and system still reflects {$42.00} due by XXXX XXXX.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo Corporate Trust Services dated XXXX XXXX XXXX. The third paragraph states ; after researching this matter further, we have verified that Wells Fargo Bank is not the investor nor does it have a direct role in servicing your current loan. Wells Fargo further stated that Wells Fargo Bank N.A acts as the master servicer for the securitization which holds your current loan. In securitizations for which we act as master servicer, the servicer works directly with the home owner. Now ; the definition of master servicer is ; an entity that acts on behalf of a trustee for security holder 's benefit in collecting funds from a borrower, advancing funds in the event of delinquencies and in the event of default taking the property through foreclosure. Now ; since Wells Fargo Bank acts on behalf of a trustee and is the master servicer for our loan which is located in XXXX Loan Trust XXXX, then Wells Fargo Bank would be able to answer the following questions. 
First, who was the investor that received the trust certificate when placing our residential mortgage loan into this pool of trust XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX? 
Second, what date did the investor place this asset into the pool of trust XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX? 
Third, who is the current investor of our note/trust certificate holder? Do not say that the trust owns our note ; I know that there is an investor and a trust certificate that was issued by the trustee at the time that the asset was placed into the pool of trust! 
Fourth ; Wells Fargo Bank sent us a letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX which states ; Wells Fargo is the investor of the loan. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo Bank believed that they were the current investor of our loan as they did on XXXX XXXX XXXX per the documents that they provided. Did Wells Fargo Bank participate in foreclosing on our loan/property on XXXX XXXX XXXX? 
Fifth ; if Wells Fargo Bank did not participate with the foreclosure process, then which company did initiate the foreclosure process on XXXX XXXX XXXX? 
Sixth ; is Wells Fargo Bank aware that fraud and robo-signing has occurred within our note/residential backed securities which is located inside XXXX XXXX?

I 'm very certain that they changed their named to Mr.Cooper  because of all the lawsuits that they keep receiving due to mismanagement of files, and also for misdirecting clients and forcing some clients to loose their house to foreclosure due to not understanding the situation of the client. 
My complaint has been going on with Nationstar for a while. It started years ago with with a simple request of a Loan Modification due to my default in XXXX XXXX XXXX. All the time through the process, they kept requesting the same documentation over and over again with no results. They claim most of the time that documents were not received or mishandled. All the time we tried to contact them for an update, there is a different representative, not only did they not know what was going on with the file, but they could not find any updates, any documentation of my file. Most of the times they kept telling me that there was no current updates and that an account specialist will follow up with me and they never did. 
It is not my fault that I felt behind on my my mortgage and have caused this large debt to be accrued. I have done everything in my part as they have requested, until this date no resolution has been reached. I finally was able to execute a complete package, and have the correct income to qualify for my mortgage.

I do n't understand why they have placed a sales date, when I been doing a loan modification to save my home, you have a complete package with updated information for a review, and you do not want to open a template for a review my loan modification for a possible solution, all you want to is sell my house on foreclosure auction unless if I can reinstate. If I was able to reinstate the loan, I would not be asking you for help when I really need it. I believe you have been "" dual tracking '' my case. If I was in process of a loan modification, foreclosure should have been placed on hold until a review is completed.

"I held a Bank of America ( BOA ) credit card ending in XXXX. ( This card was later replaced by a new card with a different account number after my wallet was lost. However you will see in the documentation the account statement evidencing the fraudulent charges I hereby complaint about. ) On XX/XX/XXXX I reported XXXX fraudulent charges to my BOA credit card by merchant XXXX but because the charges had n't hit the account BOA insisted I deal instead with the billing department. I contacted the billing department on XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that XXXX charges ( {$3.00} and {$53.00} ) were made to my account by XXXX. I was informed that these charges would be provisionally removed from my account pending investigation and if I was n't contacted for further information, they would be permanently removed. I did not see the charges removed on my next statement and was informed by the billing department that I should keep looking that they would probably show up as reversed on the next statement. I never saw the charges removed on my BOA statements. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I contacted BOA billing department regarding this issue. I was informed that the charges still appeared on my card but that the fraud servicing department would have to handle the issue. I was transferred to fraud servicing and was informed that the charges did not appear on my account ( nor did the credit/reversal ). I informed the rep that BOA stated the charges did indeed appear on my account and the rep said she 'd put me on hold and diisconnected the call. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the fraud servicing department again and after 27 minutes on hold I was informed that in order to "" verify '' who I was despite a five minute "" vetting '' of questions and answers that I would have to hang up and the rep would "" immediately '' call me back at that number to "" verify '' me for security reasons. No call back.

I refused. I attempted to contact BOA corporate headquarters regarding this issue, the telephone number listed for their offices on the internet is bogus, it reroutes you back to the number on the back of the credit card. I attempted to speak to customer service regarding whether BOA had an ombudsman group to handle the issue, each time I called I would spell the word and after minutes on hold I would be told by a clueless rep to maybe try a branch? 
By now it should be apparent that BOA has no intention of honoring my valid reporting of fraudulent billing against my account nor is the bogus fraud servicing department capable or willing to resolve the issue. As I write this complaint, I am again on hold for 26 minutes with this circus of a company. BOA has a bad reputation, BOA deserves its horrific reputation. Perhaps the new administration will look to BOA as a prime example of where to begin to drain the swamp with respect to dishonest bad faith banks and credit card companies like BOA.

"Earlier this year, I rightfully disputed my debt to Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC for {$790.00}, which was purchased from a closed XXXX   XXXX credit card in XX/XX/XXXX. After Portfolio Recovery Associates validated my debt, I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to pay off the debt. I explicitly told the representative that I am paying off the debt for full removal from my credit report, and the representative stated that a full deletion would not occur unless paid in full. With the sole purpose of removing the debt from my credit report, I paid the debt of {$790.00} in full on that call. 

However, the paid collection was not removed on my credit report, and still reflected a charge-off on my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a certified letter to Portfolio Recovery Associates to review my call with the representative, and to have my paid collection removed from my credit report. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Portfolio Recovery Associates dated XX/XX/XXXX that they would not conduct an investigation of my dispute and claim of misrepresentation. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to ask again to review my call and request for full deletion. The representative I spoke to referred me to a supervisor and they both explained that full deletions are not offered by Portfolio Recovery Associates. In addition, the supervisor stated that : - a complaint had already been filed on my account ( I never filed a complaint before ) - they will review my call - apologized for any incorrect information that was given to me. 

If I was given full disclosure with the original representative that a deletion was not available, I would have offered a settlement for far less than a payment in full. There is no incentive to a paid-in-full collection that still reports negatively as a charge-off on my credit report. 

Portfolio Recovery Associates is not fully representing the consequences of a paid collection to those looking to pay their debts in full.

I proceeded to ask if there was interest on my bill or if I had time to figure this out to contact XXXX or XXXX and she let me know that nothing had changed to my total due and I said I did not feel comfortable paying at that time since it seemed wrong and confusing and as if there was a mistake with my insurance. I also asked for an itemized breakdown of the bill to provide to my insurance and more proof of this issue. I never received anything. 

I then in XXXX had another visit to next care for an XXXX attack and asked point blank if I had any outstanding balances or money I owed and they said no. I paid a {$100.00} copay that day. I never heard from XXXX Debt collectors again or next care.

My credit score before all of this was put on my report last week was a XXXX and now is a XXXX. I have never paid a bill late until this situation due to the incorrect insurance issue. 

I called XXXX debt collectors and paid the bill in full and requested they take this off of my credit report and let them know that no one followed up with me and they claimed that through the record of our phone call that I never requested further info and that I said I would follow up with them which is FALSE. They never followed up with me about any of this. They refused to take this off my report which will now affect me negatively for 7 years. I have no track record of not paying my bills or owing them any money outside of this situation so I asked for goodwill forgiveness and they still refused even though I paid it in full within 8 months of this bill and no further attempts or warnings were made outside of 1 letter and 1 call.

"The XXXX XXXX Law Firm is attempting to collect a rental debt on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that is invalid because I have never lived there.

However, the company stated a full lease was signed on XXXX XXXX XXXX. On the contrary, I received a voicemail from the company on XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that the lease was incomplete and that some documents were not signed or completed. I also received an email on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, stating that the lease was incomplete. In reality, I only initialed some of the documents under the impression this was part of the application process. 

At this point, I believe there was intent to deceive me by providing a partial lease under the impression of a full lease. The following reasons explain how this incidence created this invalid debt and improper collection due to their deception tactics. To be specific, I believe this company was deceptive in their disclosure of documents when providing a copy of the lease and addendum during the initial application process to get an easy rental. To reinforce this, the company provided a copy of a lease that had key missing pages under the guise of a full lease. The apartments intent was to provide the remaining key documents after the applicant signs documents from initial partial lease and therefore keep the rental process moving. There also seems to be a suspiciously completed copy of the lease now with my signature on it, but it was not by me. 
Nevertheless, I cancelled the application process after I determined that a full lease and key addendum was not provided or disclosed during application process or lease review process. The key addendum stated that rental insurance was required for all future tenants. Since I disagreed with the insurance requirement and this key item was not disclosed during initial process, I did complete the lease. To be exact, I cancelled the application process.

"There was an unauthorized charge of {$880.00} to XXXX XXXX on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  debit card on XX/XX/XXXX. I caught it on XX/XX/XXXX when it was "" pending. '' I went to the bank and reported it. The bank employee completed a form and forwarded it to the bank 's corporate office. I contacted XXXX and they told me a new account was created with what appeared to be a fictitious name ( "" XXXX '' ) right before the charge was made. The person linked my debit card as his form of payment. He did not need the XXXX number on the back, only the number and expiration. Since I caught it so early, the item had not been shipped. They told me the item was going to be shipped to North Carolina. The only person I could imagine who could have had access to my debit card number and expiration date was a man who worked on my house as a handyman. My best guess is that he got into my purse and obtained the card number and expiration date. ( Ironically, this was the same payment method I used for my XXXX account, but there is no verification process when that happens at XXXX. ) He had worked on my house on and off for about a year and a half and I had not had reason to distrust him. But, in XXXX he started acting differently and his workmanship declined. He became increasingly angry and volatile and it was making me uneasy. ( I'm a single mom with a teenage daughter. ) In XXXX, I fired him. He went ballistic. Then he moved from South Carolina to North Carolina, taking a number of items from my garage with him. I believe he had developed a drug problem. He lost a lot of weight, looked ill and seemed very agitated. My best guess would be he started taking XXXX or something like it and became addicted in the months before I fired him. I was afraid of further contact with him. 

After I reported it to South State Bank, suspecting it was him, I looked at my XXXX and sure enough he had used that card to pay for his car insurance. So, I kept contacting South State Bank telling them I felt sure I knew who it was and could provide more information to them. They would never let me speak to anyone in the fraud department. No one ever contacted me from the fraud department. I finally asked for a statement of what was done, discovered, etc. by the fraud department and there was nothing. They sent me a copy of the form the branch employee filed on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not believe they did anything to investigate this. I think their fraud department may not even exist. 

XXXX did refund the money, cancel the transaction and close the fake account based on my report to them. Since the item had not been shipped, it was fairly uncomplicated in that regard. I do not believe South State Bank made any attempt to contact XXXX. 

My complaint is that my bank literally did nothing to investigate reported fraud, despite my repeated appeals for them to do so and the branch employee 's assurances that they would. There was vague statement about "" XXXX never giving us any information '' which I know to be a lie. XXXX does cooperate fully with bank fraud departments. They tried to shift the onus to the police, but without them providing any information for me to show police, I knew they wouldn't provide any information to the police either. They had never tried to obtain any information about the charge at all. There was no investigation number or contact person or phone number. As I said, I do not believe South State Bank has a legitimate fraud investigation department, though they are required to. I was not willing to go to the police and accuse the handyman of theft without a report of their investigation. That would have put my daughter and myself in danger. 

This is truly wrong. It is their obligation to investigate fraud against their customer competently and thoroughly. By not doing so, they are directly allowing criminal activity to flourish. I think it's disgraceful and likely a violation of banking regulations, such as Regulation E, the Fair Credit Billing Act, etc. 

Please do something to make them so what is expected of a bank. They are clearly part of the problem that has allowed credit and debit card fraud to increase exponentially over the last few years.",Bank / Checking / Savings

No one will coordinate on my behalf to resolve this situation, and no one is willing to provide their proprietary information so that I can move forward with other repair actions.

I have no idea how this missed payment occurred, and only for one creditor, when I made all of my payments on-time. No one is able to provide me answers, yet I have 6 months of 30 day missed payments for Barclays, which has absolutely devastated my credit reports, and caused me severe financial harm.

This is my last attempt at recourse before I begin legal action with both companies. If it was a mistake on the part of either of these organizations, I require that these delinquent payments removed from my credit reports as quickly as possible to restore my financial well-being. However, if I was truly at fault, I would like to see evidence of it and how it occurred, as my payments were managed by a third party the entire time.",Credit reporting

"American Express engaged in billing practices that were unfair and unpredictable, and resulted in wrongful interest charges of {$560.00} on my account since XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to contact American Express about these matters on several occasions, and was told that I would receive a call back from a supervisor in the credit department, but to date I have not. 

I use the charge type breakdown tool on American Express 's website to pay my credit card charges in an itemized fashion for easy track-back for accounting purposes later. Apparently I made a miscalculation when paying my XX/XX/XXXX credit card bill, and fell short of the total amount due by {$74.00}. But the interest charge that American Express charged me was calculated against the entire statement 's balance, not only the portion left over after I paid the rest of the bill. Given the amount of the unpaid portion of the bill, the amount of interest charged was well in excess of the stated APR, and indeed, in excess of the legal limit for most transactions in the XXXX. 

On the XX/XX/XXXX bill, AMEX showed a balance of XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX, and payments had been received in the amount of {$7700.00}, plus credits had been applied in the amount of {$440.00}, for a remaining balance of {$74.00}. But AMEX charged me {$100.00} in interest. The remaining balance was just {$74.00}, so the interest charged was in fact 147 % of the amount remaining, not 19.24 % ( my published APR ). When I contacted AMEX to request that the interest charge be corrected or reversed, I was told that I had "" forfeited '' the interest "" waiver '' by failing to pay the entire month 's amount due in full, so interest would be charged against the entire month -- not just the unpaid portion. I was also told that I would henceforth be charged interest on ALL monthly statements. 

In light of this experience, I have tried to ensure that I pay down each itemized portion of my bill in full -- again, using the category-by-category tool provided by AMEX. I have multiple categories to pay down, including transportation, office supplies, meals, etc., and after attempting to submit multiple payments -- XXXX per category -- on my XX/XX/XXXX bill, I received an error message from the website, telling me that I could only submit XXXX payments per day. This was unknown to me at the time, and I am still unaware of where this policy is written on the AMEX website. It also seems unintuitive because the category-by-category tool has more than XXXX categories ; I ca n't believe I am the only person who has attempted to divide payments by category. 

I called AMEX because I was attempting to pay down my bill on the day it was due, so if I had to pay the rest of the bill the following day, I would end up late again and I was afraid of receiving an interest charge based on the entire month 's bill, not only the unpaid portion. He reiterated the XXXX-per-day policy ( I have yet to see this in writing ), and offered to get AMEX 's credit department on the phone to help me put through payments in advance of the XXXX XXXX Mountain Time payment cutoff time. Moments later he said that because XX/XX/XXXX -- the bill due date -- was a Sunday, the credit office was closed. I would be unable to submit the rest of my payments, but someone would contact me to take the rest of the payments and reverse any interest charges that were applied in light of my inability to submit the rest of the payments ( especially if that interest rate was based on the full month 's bill ). Unfortunately, no one has contacted me to date. 

( Finally : AMEX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX cutoff for payments is a source of great confusion, even for a customer that has been a customer for over a decade. It was described to me for the XXXX time by a phone agent last fall. This confusion resulted in some interest charges that I am requesting to be refunded under this complaint. )",Credit / Prepaid card

"RE : Bank of the West loan # XXXX  For the last fifteen years or 180 plus monthly payments I have had an RV loan from Bank of the West.

I have made the 180 payments in good faith and the loan is now paid off.

But still Bank of the west has done great harm to my credit.

The situation is entirely their fault and I am seeking a remedy.

In XX/XX/2018 my RV loan with Bank of the West matured. I was sent a notice stating such.

The notice simply stated that the loan had matured and offered no other details. I was a bit confused because I still had payment coupons left in my payment book. I called the XXXX number for customer assistance to clarify the situation and get a payoff amount. I was told by the agent that the payoff amount was just over 4000 dollars. I was also advised by the Bank of the West agent that I could simply continue making the standard monthly payment and that would bring down the principal balance to a point where it was palatable to payoff. No mention of credit bureau reporting was made. So I continued to make the standard monthly payment.

I also continued to receive notices that payment had been received.

I thought everything was fine and planned to payoff the loan once the payoff amount was down to XXXX dollars.

In XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from Bank of the West that the bank was about to report a charge off ( default ) to the credit bureaus. I immediately called to get the payoff amount and make the final payment.

The loan is now paid in full but Bank of the West has nearly destroyed my credit. They have reported my loan to the bureaus as 60 and 90 days late, this was NEVER indicated to me in either verbal or written communications.

At this point Bank of the West has all of their money and interest, I have the RV, but my credit is ruined.

Nor have I been given an explanation of why after 180 payments there was still a XXXX dollar balance.

I think the best way of resolving this issue is for Bank of the West to remove the derogatory credit items from the credit bureaus and restore my credit score. I would also like a detailed accounting of why the payoff amount was so high.",Vehicle loan or lease

The fact that so many things depend on my score and they do not follow the rules makes me extremely angry.

I do not know how that is even possible when I never had an account with the creditor they listed and they do not supply the contact information. I have actually tried in the past though and the creditor was not able to look me up by Social or account # because I did not have an account # and Transunion would not supply me with one. My point being they negatively affect peoples credit and do not resolve issues as required. I am not supposed to have to prove something, they are supposed to report correctly and prove things should be on my report.

Looking on history of the account, the supervisor could n't find any track of an email that was sent to me regarding this issue, nor could he tell me what part of the information might have been needed for verification.

"Our home was flooded during a building water leak on XX/XX/XXXX. Our insurance company made our claim check in the amount of {$20000.00} out to us and to our Mortgage lender, Caliber Home Loans. I reached out Caliber to find out how to get the check endorsed and the funds to us in order to pay the contractor, who had already begun work and who we had already made an initial deposit. I received a packet which included a substitute form XXXX for the contractor to fill out. The packet ( which included the insurance check endorsed by the mortgage holders ) was completed and mailed off in overnight mail along with a prepaid envelope to allow for a 3-5 day return of the funds. The packet was mailed XX/XX/XXXX and marked received by Caliber on XX/XX/XXXX, per the online website Caliber  encourages its customers to use. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called to see if the funds had been processed. At that time I was informed that the XXXX was rejected. I asked why I had not been informed immediately about the problem with the form and no good answer was available. A new form was completed ( it turned out the contractor had pulled his State Comptroller ID vs his EIN ) and uploaded to the portal that same day.

On XX/XX/XXXX after still not receiving the funds and the Caliber website showing all documents received and a notation that the funds would be released four days after receipt, I once again called Caliber. I was informed that once again the XXXX was rejected. I again expressed dismay that at NO TIME was called or informed on my website portal that any documents had been rejected and that once again I had wasted time waiting for a check when none had been forthcoming. When asked why they had not contacted me there was again no initial answer. I asked what they could do to help me expedite this as I have had to borrow funds and sell other assets to pay for the work to my home while Caliber ( who has a strong interest in the homes repair ) has refused to communicate with me about getting the funds back to where they can be used. I was given two options : The first option was to have the contractor fill out a 3rd XXXX. When questioned he assured me that the EIN provided on XX/XX/XXXX was correct. When I asked the Caliber representative how we could be sure that someone one their side had not input the EIN wrong - I was told there was no way to know that. FYI - it turns out that the problem maybe that the contractor did not include LLC on their business name and per Caliber EVERYTHING has to match the IRS perfectly. Choosing this option - once again I would have to wait 3-5 days to see if the XXXX was approved. 

The second option was to request an exception since the {$20000.00} only exceeded the {$20000.00} limit for adding the contractor to the reimbursed funds by such a small amount. I said great - how long will that take? 3-5 days. Of course. 

I then requested they send me funds of {$20000.00} and keep the XXXX until they could verify the XXXX. They are not allowed to do that. I requested to speak to someone with authority and was transferred to the escalation dept. where the same discussion ( see above paragraphs ) took place. When asked why she was escalation representative, but had no additional authority over the first representative she had no response. I then asked to speak to her supervisor. I was transferred to a voicemail asking to leave my callback information and promised a return call within 24 hours which I did not, nor have not received. 

XX/XX/XXXX, after the 24 hour waiting period I called back the escalation team and requested to speak to a supervisor. In the meantime, I had obtained and uploaded to the portal the actual IRS notice with my contractors business name and EIN the difference being LLC. I wanted to know if now that they had a copy of the IRS notice if they would release my funds. I specifically said I did not want to be transferred to a voicemail, but was told they had no way to accommodate me. Once again, I left a message this time stating I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB. I have not yet heard back. 

To summarize my main complaint is the TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION by Caliber, their representatives lack of ability to mitigate the issue and any supervisors lack of response. Our insurance company was able to set up our claim, send out an adjuster, approve and pay our claim in less time than Caliber has held our funds. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I have sat around for 27 days waiting on them, not knowing that my request was on hold and needed to be corrected. This has caused me to have to sell stock I did not intend to part with and to borrow money from family in order to move the rebuilding process forward. Being in XXXX, TX post Hurricane Harvey one can not afford to bypass available contractors and subs, plus - cabinets, countertops etc are in such backorder status due to the hurricane that waiting a month causes even extra delays. In the meantime my family is living in a hotel with our home demolished ( though slowly coming back together with no help from Caliber ).

The manager told me ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they never even asked and requested the original contract for either of my 2 accounts meaning they never even read my dispute letters! They are clearly in violation and STILL refuse to delete my 2 accounts. This is complete negligence on XXXX XXXX behalf and I fully intend on suing them if they wont delete these 2 accounts after this 4th dispute letter Im sending them today! 
It has now been over 40 days since XXXX received and signed for my FIRST dispute YET are not complying with the federal law and the FCRA on having a original signed contract on file to show at the consumers ( me ) request. The only thing theyve sent me is round-about answers saying its verified and a copy of a COPY of a statement that was supposedly mine from XX/XX/XXXX and an address I never lived at! Thus, since they cant comply with my request they should in return delete these 2 accounts once again in compliance with the federal law! 

Also, have been lied too from XXXX XXXX XXXX because, I sent my dispute to XXXX and they sent me replys from a po box in XXXX and when I asked why, the representative I talked too said they come from XXXX, XXXX yet Im receiving correspondence from them supposedly in XXXX, something isnt adding up!! 

The 2 original creditors for these 2 collection accounts arent even on my credit report to begin with! ( I sent them a copy of my last report in the 4th dispute ) so how can portfolio continue on reporting these 2 unverified accounts when the original creditor that they apparently bought these accounts from still being reported??? 

Nothing ever adds up with this so-called collection company and I have been trying for months and months now to get answers but am constantly blown off, laughed at, and left even more confused on the status of my 2 disputed accounts after talking on the phone with these people? How is that possible?
I have no been dealing with this company for years! Being harassed by them and dealing with there unwillingness to ever comply with me the consumer, its absolutely ridiculous! They only comply if its in there interest but as a consumer and my right of requesting documentation under the federal law and FCRA they refuse to comply by deleting my 2 accounts that they dont have proper verification for ( original signed contract ). 

I have never filed a complaint wth the BBB and CFPB before but I will make sure I go out of my way in seeking litigation against this company for there malpractices and inappropriate willingness to comply with a consumer. 

I am tired of sitting back and being laughed at by this company when asking them for a simple demand of either providing me with my original signed contract or if they cant provide it ( which clearly they cant ) then delete these 2 collection accounts and I wont have to take this to Court! 

I am now sending out my FOURTH dispute letter today ( XX/XX/XXXX via XXXX priority signature confirmation #? ) and if we cant get this dispute and matter resolved by having portfolio deleting this 2 unverified accounts to ALL THREE credit bureaus then I fully  intend of filing a lawsuit for in-compliance on there part.

This harassment needs to cease and desist or else I will seek litigation with an Attorney for the constant harassment that occurs. This company is overstepping its maximum authority by doing this.
2nd to that, their system is not updating reflected payments that were made a day or days prior. As of today, I 'm putting this company under scrutinized investigation for Unfair Business Practices. The excuses that I continue to receive regarding their "" rules '' are not going to be accepted, because I truly do believe they have no idea what harassment is. While AES maintains they are controlling/managing the debt that is owed, they are not entitled to act as an unlawful debt collector, which is the gist of it.
If I have intentions to pay a bill and it is paid, you have no right to continue to send letters harassing either my cosigner or myself. I do n't care what the loan agreement says. As far as I 'm concerned, that 's beyond the scope of the limitations at this point because it was years ago. In prescribing debt owed, that 's what it is, debt owed. It does not legally obligate any company operating in the United States of America to create their own laws which appear to violate the laws of the Federal Government. In short, you are not entitled to act as a hostile debt collector. This is why The Federal Government of the United States created those laws to protect us civilians.

The banks have hindered me from renting selling my property and have disrupted my quality of life for the past 7-10 years.
The substantiated evidence and facts therein has been given to Chase aka the alleged owner and investor of said loan on multiple occasions. Chase stated to me for years that they are the owner of such a loan. I did not give none of the banks involved permission to use my Social Security nor my identity to obtain such a loan.
I do not have a credit history with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  WaMu  nor with JPMorgan Chase as well mention.
I have communicated with multiple agencies to investigate this alleged mortgage and find that they credit agencies have removed this alleged loan from my history in full.
Several Years ago I and my husband have filled this same complaint with the CFPB and no results so far this is why I and my husband are requesting that this be placed in the hands of the US Attorney General for legal due process.

HISTORY OF DISPUTE WITH BANKS On  XX/XX/XXXX  I purchased may home located at   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     XXXX   XXXX   CA  XXXX . jam the original owner and the first owner of my home and private property.
On  XX/XX/XXXX  my home was paid in full Cc letter from  EMC mortgage pay off dept. This loan was not reassigned not was there a new servicer nor any other banking details just PAID IN FULL PAID OFF. This came about when my husband had secured a multimillion dollar investment deal with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   The amount owed to him as of  XX/XX/XXXX  was {>= $1,000,000} USDA for this was an investment BOND for {>= $1,000,000} that was for his clothing company   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  .
 XX/XX/XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   attempted to trick us into a refinance for {$510000.00} once the good faith estimate was done the deal began to change to a basic refinance to a arm balloon deal and the offer for {$510000.00} was changed to {$460000.00} by   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  .
Thereafter we decided not to do a refinance and just keep the loan we had  with EMC Mortgage T X. So on XX/XX/XXXX  I and my husband signed the right to cancel document only and placed a copy in the mail as well faxed and delivered a copy of the RTC or rescission documents stating that we had 72 hours to cancel and we did within 24 hours.
  XXXX   XXXX   of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   d.b.a   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   sent confirmation letter that the right to cancel was excepted on  XX/XX/XXXX , as well that there was not hard hits on our credit reports. For at the time i and my husband was very concerned because we where rebuilding our credit scores which fell below   XXXX    ratings. We received the letter on thereafter  XX/XX/XXXX  with this date and it was mailed USPS metered mail with tracking and we kept both the letter and the envelope.
I continued paying EMC mortgage until  XX/XX/XXXX  received the payoff notice paid in full. As of  XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX  to XX/XX/XXXX WaMu began calling and harassing my family friends in other states and as well my neighbors stating that we did n't pay our bills and a list of other lies which did and was embarrassing at the time. WaMu claimed that they where the owner of the note or mortgage rather they never placed a mortgage assignment on the property, nor was there any written notice that they acquired servicing rights or note! they also claimed that they the investor was WMMCO located in North Carolina but we spoke with and received a letter via email that this was a fraud discovered by the FTC in  XX/XX/XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX . They later then changed the alleged Investor information to a WMBAS  XX/XX/XXXX .
JPMC [ JpMorgan ] Chase also began stating that they owned the mortgage note and stated on three occasions that they acquired it from WaMu as of  XX/XX/XXXX . The first time they stated this they claimed they acquired it  XX/XX/XXXX  Then another statement or letter claimed they JPMC acquired the note on XX/XX/XXXX  and another claim for acquisition by JPMC was for  XX/XX/XXXX  sent to me on  XX/XX/XXXX . Three different dates which are false.
We my husband and i noticed that there where some fraudulent issues being reported, JPMC claimed that i was paying them through EMC mortgage as of  XX/XX/XXXX . This is impossible because I was sending my payments to EMC mortgage Co located in Texas. No relations to JPMC until EMC was acquired as of  XX/XX/XXXX  by JPMC.
My husband received notice that a lien was placed upon his name and the house that was not in his name but my name as of  XX/XX/XXXX  for a JPMC credit card whom JPMC removed the lien XX/XX/XXXX . Very strange.
 XX/XX/XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   former employee of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    WaMu and now currently employed by JPMC place a Mortgage Assignment on my property without notice as well on XX/XX/XXXX  I was at the local  XX/XX/XXXX  County Registrar office to record a document but never saw the Mortgage Assignment as I learned that upon doing a securitization analysis and a   XXXX    report. There are also over 10 banks breaking chain of title and more please see the   XXXX   report and the securitization analysis.
 XX/XX/XXXX  myself and my husband filed a claim against   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   '' CEO and Chair of JPMC for fraud forgery identity theft and included was the missing USDA Bond fo  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   in the amount of $   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   USDA.
The case was later dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.
All this information concerning my home i.e. mortgage assignment is false we are requesting permission to file a law suite against JPMC WaMu and other banks involved. Please provide us such passage to do so. For they are claiming that we owe them JPMC {$500000.00} as well they have extorted me for more than {$140000.00}. Pain and suffering and more. JPMorgan Chase Co Bank NA and such the like of a mortgage company has yet to provide any proof of this alleged mortgage assignment nor of any real living agreement or transfer of funds for said loan. No invoice or bank check for proof of funding just a forged note.
STEPS TAKEN Multiple attempts for proof of NOTE MORTGAGE AND PAYMENT INFORMATION has been requested by   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and husband   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   with payoff and discharged options. This information was sent to the CEO Chairman/ CFO and their payoff departments as well their legal representative   XXXX   XXXX   whom writes a blog for the CFPB.

"I have a lease for a vehicle with GM Financial.

Each month, various statements reflect different amounts owed. I made a large payment in XX/XX/XXXX, thinking I had cleared up all inconsistencies, however, they continued. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a statement in the mail that reflected I owed over {$3000.00}, when I log in to the website the front page tells me I owe around {$2000.00}, and then when I go in to make the payment it tells me I owe {$0.00}.

"Summary : I purchased a custom XXXX XXXX laptop for {$2000.00} through Best Buy on my Best Buy credit card. The computer has a documented trail of regularly occurring fatal errors that XXXX technical support has not been able to resolve. I requested a replacement - which was denied - so I disputed the charge with Citi Bank who manages the Best Buy credit card. Because I did not return the laptop within 15 days of purchase, the dispute was denied and Citi Bank claims I am still liable for the {$2000.00} in charges. 

Timeline : XX/XX/XXXX : Initial purchase of custom XXXX XXXX laptop at Best Buy in XXXX CA XX/XX/XXXX : Email confirmation that order has shipped ( order # XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : Computer picked up from shippers warehouse XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : Intermittent fatal errors ( Blue Screens of Death BSOD ). Tried uninstalling and reinstalling certain software during these periods while falling back on two other reliable computers for work/school. 
XX/XX/XXXX : First formal request for support from XXXX Tech Support. Incident number XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : Second formal request for support from XXXX Tech Support. Incident number XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : Billing dispute filed XX/XX/XXXX : Billing dispute denied via telephone call Additional Details : It seems extremely unrealistic to me that the consumer should be able to determine in a fifteen day window whether or not they should return the merchandise rather than investigate resolutions independently. I chose the latter believing that if I updated the software drivers, uninstalled/reinstalled software applications, etc. that I would eventually find a solution and save myself the time required of returning and waiting for a new unit to be built and shipped. I also have two other computers at home that I use for work and personal matters. This XXXX XXXX laptop was designed specifically for my schooling and travel. It is extremely thin, light weight, portable, and powerful. As a result, it was used an estimated 15-20 hours over the six month timeline described above. All that I have asked for during all of this is a working version of the laptop I purchased. XXXX offered to send a technician to my home during working hours, Monday Friday to replace what they believe to be a faulty hard drive. I rejected this resolution as it would require me to take a paid day off from work and wait for a technician with no guarantee that it would solve the problem. It also by definition would mean that I paid {$2000.00} for a custom laptop that is now considered refurbished since the machine would have been opened and had faulty parts replaced. My request to Citi Bank and XXXX simply asked that a new unit be shipped, and in turn, I would ship the faulty unit back to XXXX. This would not only allow XXXX to prove that the unit I received was an exception, but also save XXXX the trouble and resources required of sending a tech to my home, and save me the paid time off required to meet the tech. When XXXX receives the faulty unit, they can run a more thorough diagnostic, replace any faulty hardware, and resell the unit in refurbished status. This seems to be a win-win scenario for everyone. Anything less than a complete replacement or a refund would be unacceptable by most standards.",Credit / Prepaid card

This does n't make sense since I had also paid off prior charge offs in the months of   XXXX    and  XX/XX/XXXX  and my score increased. But it gets worse.

"This is my 3rd complaint against Wells Fargo. I am trying to refinance my loan in a condo building in XXXX XXXX, Florida. I currently have my mortgage with WF and have for the last 10 or so years. All I need is a rate reduction and have been trying to do so for the last 8 months only to get the run around. They are saying the collateral is insufficient per investor guidelines, interpretating this they are saying the density exceeds allowed local/state requirements. I received a letter from the city of XXXX XXXX, I am attaching the letter, it states "" Should the damage or voluntary removal of a portion of the structure not meet the aforementioned thresholds the structure may be rebuilt subject to the originally approved site plan ''. Wells Fargo is misinterpreting the letter and denying the refi. This is not a new purchase but a refi through the HARP program. They are also using the investor '' XXXX XXXX '' as the bad guy and XXXX XXXX has only said it is the servicer to make that decision. The condo association has ample insurance for the exterior and common areas, as well as I have ample insurance for the interior if and fact such a disaster should happen. Wells Fargo 's position is so Ludacris that if such a disaster occurred and if the city used new guidelines not the originally approved plans only a select number would be able to rebuild and the rest would be out of luck, I DO NOT THINK SO. It makes ZERO sense and the city did extensive research and concluded it can be built to the original approved plan. My other complaint with WF and they are COMPLETELY evasive with answering this, they refinanced another unit in the building in XXXX. Florida has every record that is recorded online and is public knowledge. All you have to do is go to XXXX County Property Appraiser '' Copies of recorded deeds and mortgages related to XXXX properties are available online at the XXXX County Records Division website. You may search for deeds, mortgages, liens, release of liens, court judgments, condo declarations, and various other recorded documents on their website ''. This is public information, Wells Fargo when I asked the specialist last time said "" it has nothing to do with me ''. It has everything to do with me. We have the same address, same HOA just live in different units. Again, I am being discriminated against, a refinance with resolve this issue. Why is this so difficult?? My current rate is 6.75 % and it seems obvious that WF is cashing in on the interest and has made no effort to help me. The HARP program is suppose to help people, not hurt them",Mortgage
"I am currently behind in my mortgage payments with PHH Mortgage. I live in Illinois and am currently sending my payments to PHH mortgage XXXX XXXX in XXXX, IL.

"While reviewing my credit reports, I noticed some inaccuracies on my student loan account. I called XXXX and requested copies of all forbearance requests for the lifetime of my loan. Once received, I confirmed that the information that had been reported was incorrect. On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted mailed correspondence to XXXX regarding multiple late payments showing on 4 of my student loan accounts. As best as I could remember and now with the paperwork that I received from them, I was covered under forbearance during the dates that late payments were reported. I filled out all of the paperwork ( per their website ) required along with an explanation that the late payments should be removed. I also asked them to update the consolidation of my student loans as it currently showed that I owed double because the loans that were consolidated weren't updated to reflect a {$0.00} balance and closed. While checking my reports today, I saw that the individual loans have now been set to a {$0.00} balance and closed but the late payments were not removed. I called and spoke to a rep ( I do not recall his name ) that told me the only thing I could do is write another letter because they if they updated those accounts and didn't remove the late payments, they weren't going to at all. 

Here is what I sent to XXXX : According to my credit report, there were 6 late payments reported on 4 different accounts. The disbursement dates of these accounts are XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 accounts with that date ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 accounts with that date ). Under Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA, I am requesting that these late payments be removed, and the record be reflected to an "" on-time '' status for those months when the late payments were reported, the same as it does for any other forbearance or deferment period. I am making this request because my account was indeed protected under a General Forbearance during these dates. I've also enclosed documents from XXXX stating that these accounts were in Forbearance during the time these late payments were assessed. 

My credit reports states : XX/XX/XXXX - Late XX/XX/XXXX - Late XX/XX/XXXX - Late XX/XX/XXXX - Late XX/XX/XXXX - Late XX/XX/XXXX - Late Document from XXXX states : Sequences 001 through 004 were on General Forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. ( See enclosed. ) This clearly covers these dates. 

I have attached an FTC advisory opinion which interprets Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA. The issue posed in the advisory opinion is how a lender is to handle a situation when subsequent information updates a report that was allegedly accurate when it was made but no longer is accurate in the present time. 

The advisory opinion states that the Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA addresses the duty to correct and update information by furnishers, or persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRA ) such as credit bureaus. In particular, this section requires a person that has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate to promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide any information needed to make it complete and accurate. Thus, on its face, this provision requires a furnisher to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer reporting agency that it had reported to originally. This duty extends to all student loan accounts reported to CRAs, regardless of whether they were accurate at one point, because the section requires the furnisher both to update accounts as well as to correct. 

Additionally, since my loans have been consolidated, the balance on all previous loan that were included in the consolidation should reflect a {$0.00} balance. However, they are not, and it looks like I owe twice as much in student loans. Please update the correct balance information promptly to the credit bureaus.",Credit reporting

"I 've reviewed my statements from Navient for the life of my loans. They have added interest and charged interest rates while I was on Deference that they are unable to explain, justify, or give an account for. This has added to my debt and has prevented me from repaying the principle payment down, as my interest payment is higher and/or more dedicated from my payments to my loans per month, even with a 3.5 % interest rate. In addition, while I have taken several Forbearances on this loan, I specifically asked a Navient Representative if I can re-apply for a deferment where my XXXX of my loans does not accrue interest. I was told that program ( non-interest bearingDeferment ) does not exist any longer and have been misled into interest bearing forbearance. I have attached the documents necessary to show the odd and predatory interest rate charges that do not adhere to mathematical or ethical standards for the life of this loan. 
This is a predatory lender and they steer into interest accruing forbearance to keep the lender in debt for longer periods of time. My circumstance for the forbearance allowed for an actual deferment, not interest bearing forbearance.",Student loan
"I was given the WORST advice for my, then, XXXX loan! At the time I had just finished doing a 2 year XXXX.

I had $ XXXX in debit to pay off, my rewards money was $ XXXX. I was told by the XXXX representative to put my loan on deferment and use the money to pay the interest in the meantime as I figured my life out after XXXX.

"Re : COMPLAINT - PennyMac Loan-Failure to Disclose. 
Due to recent hurricane Irma, I applied for and was approved for a Disaster Forbearance Plan. PennyMac expressly stated that during the Disaster Forbearance plan period, late charges would be waived and credit reporting would be suppressed. .. BUT PennyMac DID report to the credit bureaus that I was 2 months late which caused my credit scores to plummet.

I was earnestly trying to speak with a live person. I finally sent a message through their message center. 
On the notice PennyMac sent me on XX/XX/XXXX, it states that at the end of the forbearance plan, ( XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ) I would be contacted "" to reassess '' my current circumstances as well as be provided information on alternatives that may be available to me. This did NOT happen. Furthermore, it states that "" at the end of the forbearance period, PennyMac will work with me to repay the amounts included in the forbearance agreement. This too, did NOT happen. Instead. I was bombarded with NOTICES OF DEFAULT AND INTENT TO ACCELERATE. 
In one week I made 3 payments of {$930.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX. 
PennyMac has completely reneged on the agreement to suppress reporting to the credit bureaus. Now I am concerned that my low credit scores will affect my car insurance rate, credit card rates, etc. PennyMac should be made to retract the erroneous information they sent to the three credit bureaus.

"I purchased the Condominium on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  with a  CDA  30 year fixed mortgage loan from  XXXX   XXXX  Bank. My mortgage was a little over  XXXX  each month. Soon after ( a few months ),  XXXX   XXXX  sold the servicing of my loan over to  XXXX ,  XXXX     XXXX    raised  my monthly mortgage payments to  XXXX , and later to  XXXX  each month. My financial struggles began there, but I managed the payments for years. I tried to modify this loan on four occasions with qualifying hardships ; however,  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  denied every request. I tried to short sale the property in  XXXX  as a last result, but I continued to make mortgage payments. I then received a letter from  XXXX ,  XXXX  citing that I had managed to become only  two  months delinquent ; therefore, I no longer qualified for the short sale. I struggled financially staying a month or  two  late on payments for another  XXXX   XXXX  years. I requested another modification due to financial hardship, and again was denied. In  XXXX ,  XXXX ,  XXXX  offered me access to the  XXXX  program. I was injured in a car accident, that caused me to to lose my   teaching contract   renewal, due to two months of necessary medical absences from injuries sustained from the accident. The  XXXX  program paid a portion of my mortgage while I was unemployed ( I only utilized  one of the five  years, as I was quickly employed   XXXX   in  another county  in  XXXX  ). The  XXXX  program ended immediately once employed, and I continued to struggle making payments due to the excessive amount of bills over that one year of unemployment. The stipulations were that I live in the property for 5 years ( a portion was forgiven each year  ) , but I could not be one day late on a payment within those 5 years, or the mortgage automatically defaulted. I applied for a modification and was again denied ; then applied for the short sale again in  XXXX , and was approved ( this time, I did NOT continue to make payments ).

Dovenmuele rejected the counter offer ( a difference of  XXXX  from a cash investor  ) , and has notified me that I must apply for a Deed in lieu of foreclosure, and that I now must pay  XXXX  to satisfy a lien on my property from the  XXXX  program that was not an issue, had I completed the short sale that they had just rejected.

"XX/XX/XXXX Re : Complaint of XXXX XXXX XXXX Complaint ID # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX has received your XX/XX/XXXX complaint from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Thank you for contacting us and for the opportunity to respond. 



To briefly summarize, XXXX XXXX complaint focuses on whether, as a consumer reporting agency, XXXX can properly report a bankruptcy XXXX it has reasonable grounds to believe is associated with XXXX XXXX and whether its procedures for re-investigating a dispute are reasonable. We believe XXXX has acted in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and that XXXX XXXX complaint is meritless. 



XXXX XXXX claims that XXXX has failed to provide me with a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disputed information. A cursory review of those documents will reveal that XXXX XXXX is mistaken or misunderstands XXXX obligation in this regard. 



As you know, bankruptcy records are public record and are an important source of information lenders use in making credit decisions. According to our records, XXXX XXXX originally contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to request a copy of his XXXX consumer report and place a security freeze. The consumer report was mailed to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a dispute from XXXX XXXX to validate the bankruptcy. 



According to PACER, it appears XXXX XXXX filed for bankruptcy on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition to matches on his first name, last name and address, the truncated Social Security number in the bankruptcy petition matches to the Social Security number XXXX XXXX supplied to XXXX to verify his identity. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent the bankruptcy petition to XXXX XXXX with the matches highlighted. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a second letter from XXXX XXXX stating that the bankruptcy still was not validated. On XX/XX/XXXX we again sent XXXX XXXX copies of the Bankruptcy Petition highlighting the matches on his first name, last name, address and truncated social security number that he provided to us to verify his identity. 


As XXXX has informed him previously, it uses XXXX to obtain the bankruptcy records in question and then manually compares the identifying information in the publicly available bankruptcy records to the information he supplied to XXXX. XXXX  is a federal government-licensed tool that permits licensees to access the same court records as are available as if a requestor had visited the court house in person. XXXX XXXX provides no legal basis for his position that the use of XXXX  to conduct re-investigations is impermissible, and I have found none. In contrast, I have found cases in which a plaintiff has argued that the consumer reporting agency should have used XXXX. See, e.g., XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX. XXXX ). We view the use of XXXX   to support re-investigations as reasonable. 



Once XXXX retrieved the relevant records from the court clerk via XXXX, XXXX XXXX manually matched various data points between the two data sets. You will immediately note the bankruptcy petitions match on his first name, last name and address, the truncated Social Security number in the bankruptcy petition matches to the Social Security number XXXX XXXX supplied to XXXX to verify his identity. As XXXX XXXX correctly notes, Bank.R.Proc. XXXX requires filers to truncate certain sensitive information. However, that rule does not prevent the public from relying on the information that is publicly available from making a reasonable determination as to whether it belongs to a particular individual. 



XXXX XXXX assessment of XXXX compliance with the FCRA and 5 of the FTC Act is fatally flawed. Importantly, in order to bring a valid case under the FCRA, XXXX XXXX must affirmatively demonstrate that the disputed credit information is inaccurate. See, e.g., XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX. XXXX ). In other words, XXXX XXXX will need to represent that the bankruptcy is not his. Nowhere in any of XXXX XXXX correspondence does he make that allegation. Instead, he focuses all of his efforts on whether XXXX has verified the bankruptcy. Unless he can demonstrate that the bankruptcy is not his and that XXXX was unreasonable in its reliance on a presumptively reliable source. Interestingly, XXXX XXXX complaint includes this statement : Upon speaking to the DEPUTY CLERK for JUDGE XXXX and asking the status of this pending case, I was told it is not even close to being completed as they are still determining the scope of class and motion to dismiss to be filed. XXXX has seen almost that exact same language in other, ostensibly, unrelated and unconnected complaints alleging XXXX has not properly verified that a consumer has filed a bankruptcy. But even laying that observation aside, the substantive statement is irrelevant. The fact that the underlying case is still pending does not affect the precedential value of a published court decision. XXXX XXXX fundamentally misunderstands the application of law. 



We have identified a trend of requests for re-investigations, recently. Like XXXX XXXX, they almost uniformly allege that since a bankruptcy petition does not have the consumers signature, it is unverifiable or un-validated and that XXXX  is insufficient for reinvestigation purposes. We have found instances on the Internet of so-called experts recommending this line of dispute. ( See, e.g., https : XXXX ; https : XXXX ). 



We will continue to afford XXXX XXXX an opportunity to place a consumer statement in his consumer file pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( b ) regarding the accuracy or completeness of our information.

"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau My property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX is mortgaged by Ocwen Financial Corporation XXXX ( headquarter office : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX ). 
I have been with Ocwen for around 7 years or so and I have had insurance via XXXX XXXX for the entire time I have owned the property. 

For the past 2 years, they have been doing the following things : 1. Calling me at least 2 x per day 2. Sending me letters saying, 'You have received this letter because you have not paid your bill. If you have paid your bill by the time you receive this letter, then disregard this letter ' 3. Sending me packets of XXXX page booklets saying, 'You are going to go into foreclosure. For help, fill out these forms and call us at Ocwen to assist ' They have charged me for insurance without even telling me about it, messing with my Escrow. When I realized this, I fought with them and had to get XXXX XXXX on a conference call with Ocwen again. 

In the meantime, when I call them back ( it takes 45 minutes + of wait time ) to get on the phone with them, then they tell me different stories : Story 1 : you need to pay insurance Story 2 : you owe us {$400.00} ( but they wo n't say for what ) Story 3 : your payment went up XXXX dollars per month since XX/XX/XXXX ( but they wo n't say for what- I think it is for insurance by piecing the phone call responses together ) All I want is this : 1. To STOP HARASSING ME! Do I need to sue for HARASSMENT? 
2. To stop being ignored 3. Reimbursement for insurance 4. No charging for fees that are snuck in without even telling me about it 5. Stop sending me letters ( see above ) 6. Stop sending me XXXX page packets ( see above ) 7. Tell me what they actually want WRITTEN in a clear EMAIL WITH STATEMENTS FOR PROOF 8. Stop calling me I have escalated my concerns to the entire Board of Directors and CEO and VP : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX at Ocwen with Zero response, except for more paper and convoluted phone calls. 

The latest is that an Ocwen employee called me and told me 'all I can do is listen to your complaint but can not help you ', then she was so rude, and played a game with me by saying 'you wo n't let me read you my disclosure so I ca n't help you and because you called me, I do n't know who you are ' Why even call me? I told her if she was going to play that game, then she can just call me back. Then she said she was not going to call me back. I told her that this was ridiculous we were even having this conversation because I asked simply for the company to respond via email to my email requests. She was so sarcastic and rude, telling me that she could only just listen but do nothing to help. What a waste of time, like this is some sort of a joke? I was so angry and upset XXXX, as this has been happening for months now that I let her have it. She kept talking over me so I hung up. This is abuse.

"First I would like to say that I am thankful that we have agencies in our country to help us with these matters. It is comforting to know that we can be heard and someone is looking out for the average consumer, so Thank you. 

I have a mortgage with Seterus Bank on my primary residence. Back in XXXX of XXXX I came to a breaking point financially and my husband and I split for this reason. I requested and was approved for a mortgage loan modification. The process took about a year from start to finish. In XXXX I was approved for the loan modification and my payment was made more suitable to what I could afford. Shortly after I got a letter from Seterus stating that my payment was going to jump from {$1200.00} a month to {$1400.00} a month. I asked how this could happen since I had just been approved for a loan modification and now my payment jumped to even high than I was paying before the modification. The customer service rep. said it was due to an escrow shortage. I told them I could not afford the new payment and what could be done again, reiterating that I had just been approved for a modification due to my financial situation. The customer service rep. informed me that I could request in writing to have them spread the escrow shortage over 60 months but that I should not stop making my payment of at least the modified amount every month. So that is what I did. I paid the {$1200.00} a month for that month and applied to have the escrow shortage spread out over 60 mo. I was approved for the escrow shortage to be spread out however, since I had not made a full payment they took my monthly payment and put it aside and never applied it to my monthly mortgage payment therefore showing that I missed a payment for that month. I fought to have them reduce that months payment since I had been approved for a modification as well as spreading out the escrow shortage and this was due to my financial hardship thus proving I was not able to afford the monthly payment of {$1400.00}. They refused. At this point they took my money and applied it towards the principal of the loan. I made another payment to try to bring my account current of {$1300.00} and they took that money and applied it towards late fees and other fees that were assessed and STILL did not apply it towards the supposed "" missed '' payment. I was told my only option was to write a letter to the corporate offices to try to have this taken out of the principal and applied to my payment so I would not be considered past due. I wrote the letter and they sent me a response saying that my request was denied. Most recently, I applied for a loan to purchase a new home and was denied because they marked my credit as having paid late for XXXX, XXXX & XXXX of XXXX. I asked them for a print out of my payment history and they sent it to me. I had made a payment every month for the last 2 years every single month. This payment history came from them! It showed my 2 payment that I made back in XXXX of XXXX ( when all this took place ) and still they said I was past due because they took one of my payment and applied it to principal and refused to remove it.

I asked why did I have to pay the appraisal fee to find this out. PNC advised me the 2nd mortgage company would not approve the subordination without an appraisal. My question was, yes, but did the appraisal fee have to be paid upfront in order to determine if the 2nd mortgage company would approve the subordination? PNC stated yes, the appraisal would have to be completed. 
XXXX is the 2nd mortgage holder. I am currently in a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy. After calling XXXX, I was informed that an appraisal was not needed to determine whether the subordination would be approved because I listed XXXX as a non-secure creditor. Therefore, they would not approve the subordination, regardless. 

PNC had me go thru a lot of work ; reach-out to Trustee ; have my attorney get permission from the court to refinance ; not to mention all the time involved and numerous hours involved.

On XX/XX/XXXX I took out an auto loan with Credit Acceptance Corp. Sadly I had to voluntarily surrender this vehicle because the condition of the vehicle and the necessary repairs far outweighed the value and monies owed on the vehicle. In XX/XX/XXXX the same subprime lender approved me for the purchase of a far superior vehicle. I submitted to the dealership the application as well as any and all requested documentation. All was going well until my sons college requested a tax account summary from the IRS from me. I needed to get this online immediately. In order to do this you needed a car loan or mortgage. I called Credit Acceptance for my account number and was told I didnt have an account for the newest car I had been making payments on. I finally found someone with a brain and she looked up my account by the VIN number. Turns out the second account was opened up with the wrong social security number. So I have the negative account being reported that i owe money after a voluntary surrender but the new loan with over a year of perfect payment does not show up. If you look up the credit reports under the fictitious social security number you will find a rather nice credit score and the positive account listed. I've contacted them constantly. They want me to just blindly fax my social security card to a generic number going to no ones attention. This scares me. They even deny reporting the second account to the credit bureaus under the wrong number.

"Due to Flagstar 's mistake, I had to incur an additional {$200.00} charge. They now belatedly and incorrectly claim ( after initially basically conceding that it was their mistake ) it was my mistake. 

Here 's the background : we have a mortgage through Flagstar, and our property insurance is paid through escrow they collect. We purchased the property in XXXX of XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, Flagstar accepted our property insurance policy ( in only my brother 's name ) and renewed and paid for ( out of the escrow ) our policy in XXXX ( with only my brother 's name ) and then now in XXXX they refuse to accept it/pay the renewal from escrow because my name was not also on the policy.

I was informed on Wednesday that one of these companies has obtained a judgment against me and will begin to garnish my wages effective XX/XX/XXXX, defying the laws of the state that clearly spell out that debt that is older than 4 years old can not be collected.

I achieved new and promising employment XX/XX/XXXX and I was looking forward to a productive and contributory career advancement and now this.

Navy Federal states that it is part of their credit contract to do such deductions. I was not aware of any section in the contract that was clearly visible that any such deduction could occur. 
I have also noticed a trend of certain deductions from my account being made while the payment is still pending and then a second deduction when the payment is cleared. I am fully aware of the fraudulent activity that has been happening with Navy Federal recently and I have grown concerned over they 're honesty and ability to maintain accounts properly.",Bank / Checking / Savings

"I first obtained this credit card in approximately XXXX, as a XXXX XXXX branded credit card. I do not recall the bank who serviced the card at that time.

"On XXXX XXXX ( before XXXX ), I went to a US Bank Branch to deposit my severance check and was told it may take a bit longer to have the funds available to me because of the size of the check. I pretty much ignored that because I know that the size of the check does n't matter. Once the funds are cleared from the issuing bank I should receive my funds. Unbeknown to me, the Manager on duty had placed a hold on my account where I would n't receive my funds when they cleared but almost 12 days later. All he asked me was if this was a Loan check since it was from a Mortgage company. I said no, that it was my severance check and I had n't been paid for two months and needed the money. He did note that the account was an employee account ( XXXX ). He did n't look at our account history of XXXX years of impeccable performance or do any research that would show large transactions from time to time were normal. 
Three days after the deposit, I spoke with a former coworker who received his check at the same time and his funds were available to him. I continued to check my account to determine if the funds were available and they were n't. We were forced to take an advance on our reserve line so the checks we had written and would n't clear before XXXX XXXX ( plenty of time to allow the check to clear ). 
Finally I called the Customer Service department to learn that US Bank did indeed have the funds from my former employer but would n't give them to me because the Bank employee placed a hold on the funds.

Basically, this allowed US Bank to steal from me since the money was in their possession, they were earning interest on it not me.

"XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attention : XXXX - End of Lease Dept. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AZ XXXX RE : Account XXXX Customer : XXXX XXXX Car : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Certified Mail : Fax : XXXX To Whom It May Concern, As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have been made aware that I have an outstanding balance of {$860.00} on my XXXX XXXX due to a door ding, a small crack in the windshield, and a scratch on the back bumper. I am disputing these charges based on the following information : In XX/XX/XXXX, I took out a lease on the XXXX XXXX and purchased a protection plan, which I paid extra for with each lease payment that I made TO TOYOTA. I was told by my dealership ( Toyota of XXXX XXXX ) that at the end of the lease, this would cover and dents and dings that remained on the vehicle should they determine there was excessive wear and tear. I was not told that I needed to file any claims prior to turning in the lease at the end nor was I advised that such warranty/protection plan would expire at the end of the lease and I would not be covered past my turn in date. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I turned in my XXXX XXXX with sales rep XXXX XXXX at Toyota of XXXX XXXX and also leased another XXXX XXXX XXXX ( which I will NEVER do again after having this experience ). XXXX, my salesman, did some adjustments for mileage etc. and said I was good to go. I did not expect to receive a bill in the mail for XXXX soon thereafter, as I had been paying for a protection plan! 
After receiving the bill, I tried several times to have XXXX clear this issue, as he had indicated everything was okay when I turned in the lease. He attempted to fix it and have XXXX drop some of the cost, as I was a repeat customer. I also advised him of the protection plan and asked why that didnt cover it. I did not expect to be billed. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I was called by a Toyota Collections department ( end of lease department ) and told I owe these funds. I explained that I had a service contract through XXXX XXXX, YOUR VENDOR, and was told they are not a vendor of Toyota and are not responsible. ( If they arent a vendor, then how did part of each monthly payment go to them. What a conundrum ). All I know is that Toyota sold me on this vehicle and this protection plan, and I paid for the plan through Toyota in my monthly payments. Yet, when it comes to the end of the lease, Toyota claims no responsibility and wants to have nothing to do with them! On my call around XX/XX/XXXX, I was told to file a claim through XXXX XXXX. I asked for a copy of my protection plan, as I no longer had this information. I also asked for a copy of my condition report to prove what the charges were for. They said they would mail these documents out, but I never received them ( I ended up pulling the attached condition report online ). 
I talked to XXXX, and he had another man call me from the financial office ( I cant remember his name ) who claimed he never sells the contracts as if they cover scratches. Fair enough ; I am willing to pay for that XXXX. He did say it should cover the door ding and windshield the other XXXX and XXXX. 
That is why I had purchased the agreement of course! There is no reason to worry about mechanical repairs being covered on a car I will only have for 3 years!! That would be pointless! 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX and talked to a man named XXXX. He said that all Toyota had to do was call them and file a claim and they could cover the door ding and windshield. It did not matter that the lease was over and the vehicle was turned in. In fact, because the lease was turned in, Toyota had to call for the claim and I could not file one myself. 
I had XXXX from the end of lease department to call XXXX XXXX. A woman told him my policy was expired as of XX/XX/XXXX and they could not file a claim. Please note that no one at XXXX wants to be responsible for telling customers how all of this works. No one wants to tell them to file a claim and get repairs completed prior to turning in their lease. In addition, no one wants to take responsibility after the plans are sold ; they just collect their share of the profit and claim to have nothing to do with XXXX XXXX. And now I have to play ring around the rosy with Toyota and XXXX XXXX! 
XXXX told me the lady at XXXX advised the policy was expired and there was nothing she could do, so I called XXXX XXXX back. I spoke with a man named XXXX who advised he was unable to file a claim and that the policy had expired XX/XX/XXXX. I asked for copies of my protection plans for both the XXXX XXXX AND the XXXX XXXX, since I want to make sure I am not paying FOR ANOTHER WORTHLESS PLAN! Now I am stuck with this payment for a door ding and windshield crack and no one will take responsibility for 1. 
Selling a contract by portraying it as covering dents and dings at the end of the lease. 2. The fact that I was NOT told I needed to file a claim with XXXX prior to turning in the lease. 
I have taken responsibility for paying every payment ON TIME for 3 years, in addition to the extra amount each month for the protection plan agreement. Now, after 3 years, Im told it covers nothing! 
Can someone please take responsibility so I do not have to pay the XXXX for these costs that should have been covered? The representative so graciously reduced the price from XXXX to XXXX, but I am disputing that I owe any more than XXXX. Also I have repeatedly asked about credit reporting and no one is able to tell me when or if it will get reported for my failure to pay this debt. Please advise regarding the credit reporting process.

However, after applying for a mortgage, we noticed that Westlake has been reporting late payments several times through out the last 4 years and then the last 7 months in a row they have reporting a late payment even though this truck has not been in my possession for many years. My understanding is that when something charges off, that means the company decided to charge it off the books and therefore, they can not, in turn report late payments anymore sporadically or consecutively past the charge off date. I guess what I am saying is you ca n't be late on something that charged off. They have been doing this for years and years and has caused my scores to drop big time. I have been trying to get my credit back in shape so my family could purchase a home. After working really hard to do that I find out this company has been illegally, in my opinion, and willfully, charging me late to harm my credit. I am requesting all the late payment past 2012 be removed from my credit report and specifically all the late payments over the last 2 years should be removed ASAP since I have not had the car in my possession and the account was charged off.",Other

This year, I changed my homeowner 's insurance company which increased my total insurance charge by {$200.00} for the entire year. Having researched this on Saturday, XX/XX/2018, I called Freedom Mortgage back and explained that there was no justification to increase my mortgage by {$1200.00} annually for a simple {$200.00} homeowner 's insurance increase. I further explained that I would be comfortable with them raising it by {$17.00}, which is {$200.00} divided by 12 months ( the {$88.00} visible on the attachment was a one time charge for a different insurance company that I quickly dropped and that {$88.00} should not play any part in the annual increase calculation ). Their response was that they want to implement a buffer, which I declined when I originally opened the mortgage. When I asked the rep if my original choice to opt out of a buffer should stay in place for the life of the loan, he gave a non-answer and said "" technically yes but no. '' He went on to say that Freedom Mortgage had miscalculated the escrow and they had paid out more in previous years as a result.

Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, "" A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need ''. I would like to know who, at Equifax, determined that XXXX XXXX XXXX ' request consisted of a valid need. It was not a valid need. It was not an authorized request. I have never contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire or request their services. 

Equifax stated that they will only remove the fraudulent inquiry if they receive a request from XXXX XXXX XXXX to remove the request. Considering that this is a case of identity theft, Equifax 's process is totally inadequate! I am the victim. XXXX XXXX XXXX committed the fraud. What sense does it make for Equifax to expect the company that committed the fraud to request the removal? 

Equifax has stated that I have to work with XXXX XXXX XXXX in order to have the fraudulent inquiry removed. Equifax has even refused to accept the letter that I received from XXXX XXXX XXXX that states that they are unable to determine why they requested my credit file. In this letter XXXX XXXX XXXX also stated that they run the credit reports of any customers or potential customer who simply inquires about their services. I do believe that this is illegal. An inquiry about services is not an approval/authorization to run a credit check. 

I have never contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire about their services. I have never been a customer of XXXX XXXX XXXX. The first conversation that I had with XXXX XXXX XXXX took place on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that the only way that they will submit a request to Equifax to have their fraudulent inquiry removed is if I provide them with the last XXXX digits of my social security number.

Why I am expected to now willingly provide XXXX XXXX XXXX with the last digits of my social security number when this is the company that committed the fraud against me? I offered her the Equifax case number that I have and she refused that. 

I spoke with an Equifax representative who sent an electronic file, excluding my social security number, to XXXX XXXX XXXX so they could use that to request the removal. When I informed XXXX XXXX of the file she stated that she does not have access to that system and asked that I provide that information to her. I did email the information to her. Her comment was that she can not make any guarantees!! 

Equifax 's process is totally inadequate for victims of identity theft. They are refusing to accept their responsibility in releasing my information without having proper authorization. It makes no sense for Equifax to expect the company that committed the fraud to request the removal!!

"Last year I was in the market for an apartment and I was researching mortgage rates. I found a good rate at PNC. The rate was better if I opened a PNC bank account. I did so but I did n't intend to use the account. Eventually the real estate transaction fell apart because the seller priced the apartment at {$20000.00} more than its appraisal value so PNC could not honor the loan amount. At that time I had stopped direct deposit on my rent from XXXX XXXX XXXX so I had to pay one month 's rent from PNC. This brought my PNC balance to {$1600.00}. I did not know that under {$2000.00} PNC would charge me {$15.00} per month. I received no online alert stating this. Three months later the bank called me to tell me they had removed {$45.00} from my account. I went on line and discovered that there were numerous automatic alerts in online banking including insufficient funds but this refers to insufficient funds for a check not for PNC 's limits. To get an alert for that the customer has to know that they need to set a balance alert. I am not an irresponsible person. I do n't have any credit card debt or other debts and had I known about the fee I was being charged I would have immediately put money into the account to fix the problem. Luckily {$45.00} was an amount I could afford and I was notified before this went on indefinitely. However, I know that for some of the indigent clients whom I represent losing this amount would be a hardship and could potential cause many problems for them and their families. There are benefits and drawbacks to having everything online but one benefit should be increased protections and safeguards for consumers not fewer of them. If banks are going to be able to charge fees to customers who still have money in their accounts and who have online banking they should have to send an automatic alert stating this fact when it happens. Why should they be able to choose to automatically alert me about insufficient funds but make alerting myself when they withdraw money from an account that still has money in it solely my responsibility? They did not instruct me that I needed to set up this balance alert at the time I opened my account. I trust that the CFPB will act so that banks can not hide this practice by claiming it is the consumer 's responsibility to know every aspect of online banking. Please ensure that customers know when their money is being taken by banks. If they choose not to fix the problem then that is the customer 's fault but if they are not made aware of the problem so that the bank can keep collecting fees that is a problem of corporate malfeasance.

XXXX told me that I had ALREADY pre-paid for the month of XXXX due to my XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$1700.00} and the payment in XXXX actually covered the XXXX mortgage amount due ( which was {$1200.00} ), so I was in fact meeting the loan term agreement. I asked what caused a discrepancy between the letter, her remarks and my online account. XXXX had no clear explanation. 
XX/XX/2017. Called SPS in order to again ensure that I would meet the conditions of the trial modification by paying mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX, in tandem with my salary deposit. SPS recorded the call. My husband XXXX was a witness to this conversation as I was on speakerphone. Representative XXXX informed us that though it was NOT stated in the letter, I could pay ANY DATE between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that would STILL apply toward my modification as meeting the terms of the agreement. When my husband explicitly asked if we could receive this in writing she refused and said "" we do n't need to do that ''.

This is important to note because she said that I was no longer eligible for the modification, however statements in XXXX/XXXX stated "" Our records indicate that you have entered into a Trial Modification Plan, '' so how could it be both of these conditions? I have statements dated on XX/XX/XXXX ( letter ), XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that all conflict with the verbal statements I was given.

At this time I asked Doven to provide me with the Name of the Carrier for the forced placed and information on when and where the notices were received ; no information was provided and was told this would need to be researched. Subsequently, I immediately obtained a new policy with XXXX XXXX and faxed over the information to Doven. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX was paid for the new policy from my Escrow and on XX/XX/XXXX a refund of {$4000.00} was applied to my escrow. Thereafter, I continued to make several attempts to obtain information as to why we the borrowers did not receive information of the forced placed insurance and with whom the insurance policy was with as never even received of copy of that either. One Doven agent I communicated with via chat ( chat transcript attached as Exhibit ) stated that the carrier we use for lender place insurance is XXXX XXXX. The fact that this lender only uses one carrier for forced place is alarming as it leads to believe that this servicer has some agreement with the insurance carrier and may be receiving kickbacks for only allowing them to service these high cost forced place policies. Also alarming was the fact that no notice of any intention to place this insurance was ever received and no copy of the policy or communication from the insurance company was ever received. 

My efforts to obtain copies of the alleged notifications and policy continued as I strongly believed and still do that the insurance was placed without proper notification in order to allow me the opportunity to renew my former policy or obtain new coverage ; many request were made via email ( at their request ) on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I received correspondence from Doven dated XX/XX/XXXX ( please make note it is postmarked with a stamp of XX/XX/XXXX envelope copy attached as exhibit ). The correspondence included a cover letter, copies of three notice letters and a copy of the policyNotice of lender placed insurance ( all attached as exhibits ) ; the first notice dated XX/XX/XXXX is addressed to XXXX XXXX, a firm who assisted us with a modification last year and despite them sending mortgage statements to our property and home address this notice was not directed to us but to XXXX XXXX at a XXXX XXXX address. The additional two notices XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are not even addressed to a physical location and do not contain a mailing address. This is not proper notice as required by law. 
II. Issue with credit reporting The servicer, Doven has inaccurately reported and misapplied payments for the trial modification period that occurred XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX and as a result is also reporting these payments as late payments on the borrowers credit reports. Additionally and most concerning, the XX/XX/XXXX payment was never even applied. I emailed Doven regarding this issue on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and also provided them with a copy of the cashiers check which we paid with and which clearly depicts they received and deposited it and I have yet to receive a response or correction of this. 

This kind of mismanagement and repetitive errors place great financial hardship on homeowners and result in financial devastation and many foreclosures just to line the pockets of unscrupulous lenders and mortgage servicers.",Mortgage
"I moved in XX/XX/XXXX. I have four Citbank credit cards and in late XX/XX/XXXX, I called the XXXX number on the back of each of the four cards to change my address. 

However, unbeknownst to me, the customer service agent who took me call for the Citibank AAdvantage card did not apply the address change. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX. I received a call on XX/XX/XXXX from an internal collections department that my Citbank Aadvantage card was in arrears of {$900.00}, with a  total balance of {$4600.00} due. When I said that I was unaware of this as I had not received a bill since XX/XX/XXXX, they said "" yes. We know. They were returned to us as undeliverable and we had no way to get in touch with you. '' They gave me the number of the recovery unit. 

I have a bunch of problems with this feeble excuse. First of all, I have three other Citibank credit cards that manage to get to me every month. Second of all, neither my email nor my cell phone # has changed in more than 10 years. And third, how is that the credit reporting unit had no trouble finding my home or cell phone? 

I know that this will lead to a huge ding in my credit report, so I called the recovery unit on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX. I managed to convince the man I was speaking with to investigate the claim in an effort to keep it off my credit report. I also asked to pay the entire outstanding amount in full. But he could not guarantee that my credit would not be tarnished. He told me to fax a letter to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told to call back in one week ( XXXX XXXX ) after XXXX to learn about the results of the investigation, and that in the meantime, the account would not be sent to an external collection agency and that I should not speak to the INTERNAL collections unit if the called again. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from an EXTERNAL collection agency telling me that i had outstanding debt on this account. I told her that I would be speaking with the recovery unit as promised, at XXXX. When I called the recovery unit, they "" had not yet gotten to the investigation yet '' and had no record of sending the fax. ( I subsequently resent it again today ). When I asked why the account had been sent to an EXTERNAL collection agency despite reassurances that it would not happen, his response was "" Citibank always abides by federal rules and statues when it comes to this type of thing. '' I spoke to his supervisor, who had no more light to shed on the status. 

So, I 'm in limbo because they made a mistake in not applying my change of address. And they did n't bother to do anything about trying to find me. I could call the EXTERNAL agency and pay off the debt in full, but I 'm reluctant to pay it in full ( I could just pay the arrears ) if my credit report will still get dinged. And no one can answer any of my questions. It 's a huge circular vortex. When I called collections, they ca n't 'see the account ' because it 's in recovery. Recovery has had it for a week, has n't done a thing, and in fact, sent the account to an EXTERNAL collections agency when they said they would wait.",Credit / Prepaid card

"Issue descriptions shown- Debt is not mine is closest to describing the situation. There is NO debt. 
Alleged creditor is XXXX. Purchased phones from XXXX XXXX 2013. Not satisfied with service. Returned phones within 10 day satisfaction period. XXXX attempted to collect {$320.00} for termination. At first attempted to not allow portage of phone numbers to XXXX. After 3 1/2 hours at XXXX, vendor in store was finally successful in accomplishing this. 
When I requested for XXXX to provide a copy of the contract proving the debt was valid, they did not. After attempting for several months to collect by making harassing phone calls, XXXX turned the {$320.00} amount to an initial debt collector. 
This debt collector actually sent written communication about collection. I requested that they provide written documentation that the debt was valid ( any documents such as a contract ). Just like XXXX, they did not. 
This debt collector then apparently sold the alleged debt to another collector- AFNI. I did not receive any written communication from them about collection. I believe this may be in violation of the FCRA. They made several harassing phone calls. I requested that they provide written notification about attempted debt and to not contact me anymore until they have provided that. They never have. They also have not provided written documentation that the debt is valid. Since they never gave written notification as to what the debt was ( XXXX ), it has not even gotten to the step of my requesting that they provide written proof of the debt. 
Instead, they have added this item to my credit report and show it is in collection. As well, it is showing in the report that they have turned it over to attorneys for collection. I believe this may also be a violation of the FCRA since it is merely an intimidation ploy. 
Based upon complaints I have read about AFNI, they are unscrupulous in their methods and have many violations of the FCRA on their record. They added it to my credit report without providing any written documentation about the collection OR written documentation showing proof that the debt is valid. They add it to a credit report as leverage to collect the debt and did not act either ethically or legally. 
My credit score was XXXX prior to this item. I have had only XXXX missed credit card payment due to a delay in the mail on my report prior to this. It is now down to XXXX because of this item. I disputed it and Experian indicated that it is valid. I am not sure how AFNI was able to prove that it was valid since they have never communicated with me via any written form. I would like to have this item removed from my report entirely and also pursue legal action against AFNI due to violations of the FCRA.

After being told I didn't qualify for a refinance with Wells Fargo ... and endless calls asking about the HARP or streamlined finance or using equity in my home, etc. I was referred, by a Wells Fargo employee via phone, to a company to assist with the HARP process. I was instructed to fill out paperwork and then told to make a reduced payment, by money order for 4 to 5 months, while they processed everything. I was assured that the Florida company would be my voice to Wells Fargo, and checked back with company in status every 10 to 14 business days. In XXXX of XXXX, while leaving for my daughter 's theater performance. A gentleman came to my door and said he wanted to see if I had rights to any of the equity in my home, as it was sold at auction the previous Tuesday. There was no notice received, I was in shock.

In the scramble to find housing, and pack up myself and XXXX children, I lost some of the paperwork which had the Florida company name. 
I know that the home had some renovation and then was sold by the auction purchaser for over 2x the amount I originally financed.

"In XX/XX/XXXX and into XX/XX/XXXX we experienced a substantial drop in household income which led us to fall behind on our mortgage payments. In an effort to save our home and prevent foreclosure we began working with Bank of America to see what programs we might be eligible for. 

Over the course of the following 6 years we tried several times to bring our loan current with Bank of America. There were work-outs and different types of modifications ( including HAMP ) and each time we neared the end of the process as explained to us something would "" happen '' and we did not complete the program : often times after being told by a Customer Relationship Manager ( CRM ) that we had reached the end and our loan was going to be modified. On at least two instances we were told our file was "" going to the courthouse '' for the paperwork to be filed within a week ( one time we were told our paperwork WAS taken and entered at the courthouse ). The CRM told us we should be receiving information explaining how to make payments or set up auto-payment in the next couple of weeks. Instead, two weeks later we received a letter stating we had voluntarily removed ourselves from the program. Appealing and escalating to find out what happened took the next 8 months, and we still have never been given the same answer twice. 

After filing bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX we anticipated losing our home, but after the bankruptcy passed and we still had our home we again started the process of attempting to modify our loan. Again the process was wrought with issues that were just hard to explain. Documents were not processed timely, notary signatures were rejected ( even after going to a Bank of America branch location to have the notary services performed ), underwriter review was inconsistent and it took 7 months to navigate completely through the program and ( finally ) reach a successful modification. 

While preparing our home for sale a title search turned up XXXX liens placed against our deed from HUD. This was a surprise to us, as we had never successfully completed a modification plan. After putting all the pieces together we discovered these were from the earliest of our unsuccessful attempts to modify our home loan. We have met with nothing but resistance to adequately investigate these fraudulent liens from Bank of America while being told by managers and CRM 's along the way that they see the issue and they are going to "" escalate '' our problem. 

The facts are plain : our interest rate remained unchanged from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, as no modification took place. Prior to the successful modification in XXXX XXXX our past due amount was around {$35000.00} ... an amount that is mathematically impossible if the XXXX lien amounts from HUD ( totaling over {$15000.00} ) were ever applied to our account. The XXXX liens were entered on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which again is impossible as there is only 14 days between the XXXX dates and we could not have gone through XXXX modifications in two weeks when it never took less than 5 months on any occasion ( sometimes as much as 9 months ). 

We have never denied signing and notarizing the Subordinate Deed and Deed of Trust as part of our attempt to modify, but the plain truth is that after returning those documents Bank of America never fulfilled their end of the deal and completed our modification. In essence, documents were delivered to HUD and to our county Register 's office FRAUDULANTLY AS BANK OF AMERICA NEVER APPROVED OUR FINAL MODIFICATION IN THESE INSTANCES ... resulting in negligence on their part, either intentionally or unintentionally, that has prevented us from selling our home on at least one occasion in the past and is threatening to prevent another in three weeks. We simply want to sell our home and never have another transaction with this licentious financial institution again.",Mortgage

"I recently completed a permanent loan modification with Bank of America. The loan modification was recorded on XX/XX/XXXX by Bank of America ( exhibit A ). Once this loan modification was recorded, a new interest rate of 2 % was registered and my principal was reduced by XXXX to {$200000.00}. In order to qualify this Making Home Affordable aka HAMP modification, three trial payments were required to be paid. These payments were dueXX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX& XXXX. After all three payments were made timely, a permanent loan modification was due to be issued as phase two of a two-step process. The trial agreement is a sole and separate contract that leads to the new permanent loan modification contract. Since the permanent loan modification agreement is a recorded mortgage note, it must adhere to the principals of RESPA law. RESPA law requires that mortgage notes move interest collected forward in time, since mortgage interest accrues in arrears. With that being said, since this mortgage note was recorded on XX/XX/XXXX, the first full payment of {$1300.00} be due XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America has a XX/XX/XXXX payment due date, which obviously violates RESPA law and would affect the TIL mathematical calculations. I spoke to a manager at Bank of America ( XXXX XXXX ) He advised that Bank of America they is still collecting on the trial loan modification payments, even though the permanent modification has been recorded. Per clause 4 ( B ) in the new mortgage note, it clearly states This agreement supersedes the terms of any modification, forbearance, trial period plan or work out plan that I entered into with the lender. Therefore, there is no way to apply the any funds paid on this mortgage note prior toXX/XX/XXXX. Understand also that since this a Making Home Affordable modification deal, the Federal Government compensates Bank of America for economic loss. The mere fact Bank of America is trying to over collect on the debt and also bill the Federal Government is preposterous. The National Mortgage Settlement in XX/XX/XXXXclearly established law relating to bait and switch tactics relating to trial loan modification contract transition. Bank of America was the principal party named on the XXXX National Mortgage Settlement. Moving forward to XX/XX/XXXX, B of A transferred my loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX claims that the loan was 90 days past due and had a {$1000.00} negative escrow balance at the time of the transfer. There is absolutely no way the the escrow could have been deficient at the time of the transfer, since the regular escrow payment due was {$320.00} per month and B of A was collecting {$430.00} per month. If anything, I am due an escrow refund from B of A. XXXX also forced me into a forbearance plan that increased my payment {$1400.00} per month, based on the alleged delinquency purported by Bank of America. Overall, I have overpaid my mortgage payments by over {$4600.00}. Since my regular monthly payments are {$1100.00} per month, I have over paid by three full payments plus a credit of {$1000.00}. Since both Bank of America and XXXX claim I am still delinquent, I am seeking your assistance on this matter.",Mortgage

I depend on my business revenue to survive and I can not and will not be able to pay bills, employees, or house expenses because SunTrust has taken the liberty to hold on to my funds for 3 weeks. What am I supposed to tell my employees who also have families? I have a payroll on Friday XX/XX/XXXX, how am I supposed to pay this? 
Please make this right for me. My account with SunTrust is closed for Regulation Reasons, and nothing else. My funds should not be held for 3 weeks or longer, how am I as a business owner and a consumer going to be able to pay my employees and other expenses as I should. I feel that since you have taken the liberty to close my account, once my funds have cleared I should be able to utilize the debit card that I must remove my funds from SunTrust Bank. I dont live in an area where I can go to a SunTrust location. I live in XXXX, Arizona. 
I hope that one of the individuals reading this email will take the liberty to make this situation work for me as well. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I sent this one I emailed you and others in the SunTrust Corporate office about the above-referenced account. No one has taken the liberty to call me back or even respond to my email. Leaving me to the understanding that SunTrust does not care about its customers. With SunTrust closing my account abruptly, it has left me with no money to pay my employees or my bills. 
I have employees that have checks to be cashed this Friday, and last Friday. But if they deposit them the checks will bounce due to the actions taken by SunTrust. This is such an unfair action. I am told that my account is on a No-debit status, but that the bank is holding my money to see if checks are presented. Whether the checks are presented or not the bank is not going to honor them. 
It seems to me that SunTrust bank should release my funds so that I may be able to pay my employees. 
And this was my final email. Still with no resolution. 
Today I have had two of my candidates call me because their checks have bounced. A Candidate said that she couldnt pay her rent because her check bounced, and the other cried on the phone this young lady has XXXX small children. As of today, when talking to XXXX XXXX XXXX, there is still no valid answer as to why my account is being closed or why my funds are on hold. 
On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I had a conversation with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who assured me that the two checks mentioned above would be paid she said that they would be forced paid because my ACH deposit would hit my account on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1900.00} in which the deposit did post to the account. 
Not only is this issue with SunTrust affecting me, it is affecting my employees. Yet in still I have not been given a valid reason as to why checks were not paid and/or why the account is being closed. 
This is very unacceptable. The remedy to this situation would be that SunTrust Bank should release the funds out of my account so that I can pay my employees and other financial obligations. 
I am very upset and disappointed in the way that this is being handled. I have called XXXX XXXX and was told that I would receive a phone call back this afternoon. I have yet to receive that phone call. 
XXXX The Resolution that I am looking for is that SunTrust Bank release my funds immediately and compensate my candidates for any bank fees that they have incurred due to the SunTrusts actions.",Bank / Checking / Savings

Exeter approved me to have a modification of my loan through the XX/XX/XXXX payment for the XX/XX/XXXX that will be paid on or before XX/XX/XXXX, which is within 30 days of that payment being due. I am not sure how they fix one issue and report I am delinquent on another month when that payment was due XX/XX/XXXX and it was made on XX/XX/XXXX, which is within 30 days of the due date. I am confused how a payment made before it was even 30 days late it reporting on my credit report as a 30 day late payment. 

Company 's response in prior compliant # XXXX : Your account was 48 days past due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment when we received your payment on XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, you were accurately reported delinquent for this payment. In your complaint, you stated an email was forwarded to our office on XX/XX/XXXX regarding your bill pay. We are unable to locate a record of this email ; however, in compliance with FCRA laws, credit dispute investigations may take up to 30 days to complete. We appreciate your efforts to make all payments in a timely manner. Based on this complaint, we have agreed to remove the late mark that was caused by your banks processing error. We have updated our internal records and provided the corrected information to the credit reporting agencies. Please allow up to 30 days for this update to reflect on your credit report. Our records indicate your account was placed in a cease and desist status in XX/XX/XXXX based on CFPB complaint XXXX. To remove this status from your account, you may fax or email a written and signed request directly to the Office of the President at XXXX or XXXXXXXXXXXX.

"My father died as a non-resident alien with an account in the United States. 

I am the executor of his estate and non-resident probate has been granted in XXXX XXXX, New Jersey. I am a US citizen and resident. 

There is only one asset to be probated.This money is in an orphaned account at XXXX, XXXX the financial clearinghouse of BNY/Mellon. The money is in cash. It was in a cash account at a brokerage firm that went defunct many years ago which is how it ended up in XXXX. This account is NOT associated with any US business. 

XXXX had several requirements to release the money NONE of which they would put in writing, all verbal. Once I sent the latest requirement, they came back with two more. One of those I am willing to comply with as it is reasonable. 

I believe they have no valid reason for the second requirement. 

This second requirement is that I receive a transfer certificate from the IRS. Please note that the purpose of a transfer certificate is if the money is leaving the country. I am asking for the money to be transferred from my father 's account in New Jersey to his Estate account in Pennsylvania. The IRS will be able to track the money through the EIN of the Estate. 

Here are the reasons why I think a transfer certificate is not required : 1. On the IRS website, under "" Transfer Certificate Filing Requirements for Non-US Citizens, it states "" ... A transfer certificate is NOT required for property administered by an executor or administrator appointed, qualified, and acting within the United States. '' 2. XXXX also states that this is required because the assets in the account are over {$60000.00} ( It is about {$120000.00} ). On the IRS website under the same heading it says "" If the value of the decedent 's taxable assets in the United States exceeded XXXX '' It refers you to Form XXXX to determine what are "" taxable assets in the United States . '' XXXX is taking the position that the physical location of the assets determines that is a taxable asset. That is, that if in the US, it is a US taxable asset. 
Reading the instructions that is not correct. It breaks down US "" taxability '' of assets based on the type asset, not merely physical location in the US. For tax reasons US situated assets include American real  estate, personal property, and securites. 
Exceptions to XXXX "" taxability '' include securities that generate portfolio interest and bank accounts not used in connection with a trade or business in the US and insurance proceeds.

3. At this time the only money in the Estate account is the {$5.00} required to open it. There is no money in the Estate until XXXX transfers it. 

I have complied with all of XXXX requirements but I am not willing to comply with this one without a valid reason.",Money transfer / Virtual currency

"Dear XXXX and XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, CFPB, This is in response to your letter dated XX/XX/2018 via the CFPB portal. 

XXXX and XXXX demands monies for an alleged debt for which no proof of said debt, nor proof of ownership of said debt, has been verified and exhibited. XXXX and XXXX provide no relationship to said creditor hence could be viewed as fraudulent practice. 


XXXX XXXX XXXX, the compliance attorney as shown on the letter from XXXX and XXXX explained they are not the owner of the said debt, but however failed to provide answers to my previous questions on fraud and the company violations. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX may be qualified to explain what XXXX and XXXX did or with respect to its own records or data created during its time, but he can not establish a foundation for the bank data XXXX XXXX XXXX has no personal knowledge, XXXX XXXX was not a custodian of the banks records while they were with XXXX XXXX, and the records in the XXXX and XXXX possession do not qualify as ordinary business records. Because the electronic file transferred to XXXX and XXXX  did not come to XXXX XXXX XXXX as ordinary business records of XXXX XXXX, it can not be said that the data in this file became routine business records of XXXX and XXXX, maintained in the ordinary course of business. Therefore, the documents created by XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX and XXXX copy of the electronic file from the transferred accounts could not be said to be routine records maintained in the ordinary course of XXXX XXXX  business. This means that XXXX XXXX XXXX affidavit is inadmissible and XXXX XXXX did not have a foundation to be a witness to identify the source documents, the monthly statements or the cardholder agreement. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX avers that he is a compliance attorney of XXXX and XXXX. This means he is not an employee of XXXX bank or previous collection agency that have collected money from XXXX XXXX, and therefore has no cognizable standing as either a custodian or qualified person to establish the nature of file data as a business entity, without first establishing an adequate foundation of the witness as a person with actual knowledge, and then establishing how he obtained any of the knowledge to which he testifies. 

Most disturbingly is the fact that XXXX XXXX XXXX intentionally failed to respond to my accusation of re-aging debt which has been reported. 

The Federal Trade Commission has stated that disclaiming the accuracy of information is common and recurrent ( FTC DEBT BUYER REPORT, supra note 2, at iii, 25 ). The Restatement ( Second ) of Torts describes a fraudulent misrepresentation as being when the maker does not have the confidence in the accuracy of his representation that he states or implies or knows that he does not have the basis for his representation that he states or implies. 


Without a copy of the underlying contract, XXXX XXXX has no objective way to assess the veracity of Plaintiffs claim. The FDCPA is a strict liability statute intended to be liberally construed to protect consumers ( XXXX v. XXXX. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX Cir XXXX ). XXXX is not an element of proving an FDCPA violation. Misleading or deceptive representations made as a result of carelessness or negligence are actionable under the FDCPA. All a court needs to find for an FDCPA violation is that the communications from the debtto the consumer would have been misleading to the least sophisticated consumer ( XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ). XXXX XXXX your communication was clearly misleading as evidence from your first letter dated XX/XX/XXXX to your most recent letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. Your company alleged the account has not been reviewed and then on request for validation claimed it was reviewed. 

In XXXX and XXXX submitted documents and brief there are two contradictory Balances which XXXX XXXX XXXX claims XXXX XXXX owes, in Exhibit 1 for {$1600.00} and in Exhibit 2 for {$1500.00}, demonstrating thereby a lack of sufficient indicia of trustworthiness for accounting in this instance to be considered reliable ( XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) ). 


XXXX and XXXX alleges that XXXX XXXX retains XXXX and XXXX for the purpose of legal collections on the account on XX/XX/XXXX. Yet they wrote a letter 4 days after stating the it has not been personally reviewed. XXXX attached dated XX/XX/XXXX. Then XXXX and XXXX made it very clear that XXXX remains the owner and holder of the account. Which means XXXX and XXXX is a third party with lack of standing to sue. Since XXXX XXXX neither have a contract with XXXX and XXXX and neither have XXXX and XXXX  disputed that fact, I will suggest that XXXX and XXXX  identify and provide If XXXX XXXX  card company had made an agreement with the XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, then XXXX XXXX is not a party to those terms. Just because an assignment clause exists in a credit agreement does not mean that it is sufficient to create a new obligation with the XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The assignment clause merely takes away the rights of XXXX XXXX  which is the original credit card company to collect if they decide to assign it to another company, in this case XXXX and XXXX XXXX   XXXX. The collection company would then have to offer you a new contract, you would have to agree to its terms, and you would finally have to sign this new contract. If you have not signed a contract with the collection company, you owe them nothing. 

XXXX XXXX is not an assignee for the purported agreement, and XXXX XXXX representing XXXX and XXXX has not offered any evidence to the contrary. 

XXXX and XXXX has not produced any evidence that supports any related claims or assumptions. XXXX and XXXX for the collection company has failed to produce any document that shows they are assigned by XXXX cards or any original credit card company has named them as assignees, nor has he even shown that the original credit card company has any knowledge of his actions, or that the original credit card company has even given this collection company, all rights and control.",Debt collection

"Going back to XX/XX/2018. I had logged into my account early in the morning without incident to check my balance.

This just made me even more upset at the whole situation.

I had balanced my account on paper ( -as advised by an arrogant person in their Corporate office when I had the exact same issue ) but because the bank posts transactions differently and not in the order in which the date the transaction was made, it gives them the power to assess {$170.00} in overdraft fees as opposed to 1, 2 at most. It is not right they can minipulate the order in which transactions are posted and then have corporate have the nerve to tell me to keep a paper journal.

At this point, I had my bank statement and asked about the  XXXX  dollar charge. Th e Umpqua  Representative responded that it was a federal law. I explained that it was not dormant because a not all payment went into checking, a transfer occurred to the loan and Umpqua Bank is charging 7.75 % interest on the loan. She explained that if I did not physically do anything with the account, it was therefore dormant. I asked her how this could be in a day when technology allows us to take a picture of a check. There are less and fewer bank consumers doing their banking physically. She continued to deny that the account was active and there are numerous {$3.00} charges as well as who knows how many {$5.00} charges have occurred.   At this point, I am being told by the  Umpqua Representative that my account is dormant while Umpqua Bank is making roughly {$100.00 } plus dollars and charging an additional {$3.00} along with {$5.00} each month.

"My complaint is against VW Credit. I opened a loan at a VW dealer with them on XX/XX/XXXX. The dealer is another story which has to do with the finance department whose best practices are terrible. They did not even go over the paperwork with me which is why i got, excuse me, screwed. If you think that would be a good complaint, then please let me know. But for now, lets just take VW Credit. I worked in the computer banking service bureau environment for over 25 years starting in the late XX/XX/XXXX, so i know all about banking which includes credit bureau reporting. I worked with XXXX and XXXX in the dark ages and know how reporting is supposed to be done. The credit bureau reporting of VW Credit is horrible. It is not consistent ( monthly ) reporting and some fields are inaccurate and field accuracy is different between what they report to XXXX and XXXX. A big problem has been that they keep reporting my monthly payment wrong and also the date of last payment, and did i mention they have sporadic updates? yes i know i did. I have a very good credit rating ( high XXXX ) and have made a couple of bad financial decisions and under normal circumstances, i would not even report this, but these people need some talkin ' to about their procedures. Their monthly statements do not even have a stmt date on them! As for the monthly payment, originally it was {$320.00}, but when i decided they screwed me on the Extended Warranty and Gap insurance ( this was a 3 year lease that came back that i bought ), that was taken off and it went to {$270.00} and every since it has been reported wrong.

Apparently, though, these "" Valid Thru '' dates are not the actual expiration dates on the card. Instead, USBank helped themselves to {$2.00} per month after 12 months had passed on each card. Even though the "" Valid Thru '' dates on the fronts of the cards said XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, in actuality, all three cards have been completely drained by USBank. 

This seems to me to be a deceptive business practice. A reasonable person would expect the "" Valid Thru '' date on the front of the card to be the date the card expires.

"On XX/XX/XXXX, a friend used the XXXX platform to transfer me {$1300.00} for her portion of our house 's rent payment for the month. Both of us were registered with XXXX, and had it linked to our respective bank accounts. XXXX markets their XXXX transfer product as nearly instantaneous, where funds can be transferred within minutes, which is why we opted to use this platform rather than XXXX, which can take 1-2 business days to transfer. 

The money was taken out of her XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX, and I received a text message from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating that she sent me {$1300.00}, the correct amount of the transfer. By XX/XX/XXXX, I had still not received the deposit, and followed up with XXXX XXXX XXXX via a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the transfer. They told me that sometimes a first time transfer can take from 1-5 business days to process. At that point, I agreed to wait until the 5 business day mark, even though at no point during the signup for transfer confirmation process did they mention that a transfer could take longer than the much marketed "" minutes. '' On the main page of their website, a footnote even says, "" Transactions between enrolled XXXX users typically occur in minutes. If your recipient is not yet enrolled with XXXX, it may take between 1 and 3 business days after they enroll. '' We had both been enrolled with XXXX for some time, but decided to wait until the 5 day mark that was told to me my XXXX XXXX XXXX 's customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX before becoming truly worried. 

At that point, the wait time for my transfer created great financial hardship as we had to make our rent payment by XX/XX/XXXX, the third business day after the day of the transfer. I had to transfer the amount of her rent out of my savings account to make sure I had sufficient funds in my checking account. Had we not paid this on time, we would have incurred a {$1000.00} late fee from our landlord. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received the transfer funds, marking the XXXX business day after the original transaction. I once again contacted XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and I was told that sometimes transfers can take longer, but that the transaction was processing and would be deposited into my checking account that same day by XXXX. The customer service representative connected me to their XXXX help line, where I spoke to a XXXX customer service representative. He told me that sometimes a first time transfer can take 1-5 business days to complete, but once I relayed that we were now on the 7th business day after the transaction, he could not explain why it was taking so long, but also assured me that the money would be processed into my account by XXXX that night. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX again, inquiring about the funds that had not been deposited into my account since its initial transfer 9 business days prior. Once again, I was told that the transaction was processing, it should be deposited into my account by XXXX that night, and that there was nothing further she could do to track the transfer. 

On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, it marked two weeks since my friend had transferred the money to my account. I still did not have the money in my account. I took my lunch break from work to go to a physical XXXX XXXX XXXX branch to try and solve the issue once again. I was told that all she could do was connect me to the XXXX, and could not track the payment since it was a XXXX transaction. I left the branch, and called XXXX XXXX XXXX again. The customer service representative could not tell me why the money had not deposited, and could still see it processing. She told me at this point that I should remove my phone number from my XXXX account, and re-sign up for the service. She also told me that I should have my friend who initiated payment call her bank and have the transfer cancelled. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, the 15th day since the original date of transfer, I have still not received the transfer. I had to transfer money out of my savings account, and have taken time out of my workday to make phone calls and visit a XXXX XXXX XXXX branch to try and resolve this issue. My friend has contacted her bank, XXXX, to try and cancel the transfer, but was told that the money has already been deposited into an account. She also contacted XXXX, to track the status of the deposit, but XXXX told her to contact her bank. 

At this point, the money is still not in either of our accounts, and {$1300.00} is in financial transfer purgatory, where no one seems to know where it is. All three parties involved ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) have repeatedly pointed fingers to the other to try and shift the blame for not being able to control their own fund transfers. This is a horrible example of operational control by institutions that are supposed to be protecting our money. I no longer have faith in my financial institution, and am more wary about using my own bank to transfer funds, than a third party service such as XXXX. A platform that is backed by most of the big banks in our country should be able to accurately track XXXX transfers in real time. There should be no question about where a money transfer is at any step in the process, and there should be set contingency plans in place if the transfer fails, instead of just saying to contact someone else to deal with the issue. XXXX 's internal controls are ineffective, and dangerous for customers if they are going to try and continue to take over the XXXX transfer market.

"Im victim of identity theft are contacting your credit bureau ( EQUIFAX ) to inform you of my lawsuit against your credit bureau. Currently, the XXXX XXXX is scheduled for XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX. The lawsuit was filed due to the utter lack of response from your company. When someone is the victim of identity theft, it is simply a nightmare trying to get false information removed from a credit file. Im also suing Equifax for being negligent regarding my credit files being affected by the cybersecurity incident, and breach with ( EQUIFAX ). This credit bureau had a enormous security failure, and it has affected millions of consumers worldwide. I am XXXX of those consumers that have been affected, and Im seeking justice regarding fraudulent accounts that are being reported on my credit files at this time. My social security number, drivers license, birthdate, and personal information was COMPROMISED/AFFECTED by the cybersecurity incident. I have filled out my information online under the website : XXXX and it clearly shows that my ( PERSONAL INFORMATON WAS AFFECTED BY THE BREACH ). The consumers as myself that have been affected should not have to deal with having fraudulent accounts reporting on their credit files. Due to this incident all consumers that where affected should have their credit files, and personal information updated/restored. If fraudulent accounts where opened in their name, and their information was compromised it is your credit bureau department to have those accounts REMOVED/DELETED off of the consumers credit files. I should not have to suffer, or battle with fraud accounts that where opened in my name due to the negligence of your credit bureau. This breach has caused me so much grief, has put me in a financial bind, have made me have to go through the emotional/financial stress of dealing with creditors that are trying to validate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, because my ssn was compromised. I have contacted the false creditors listed on my credit file with the companies who have reported fraudulent accounts on my credit file by the name of : XXXX XXXX PERSONAL LOANS & XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have challenged all of the false listings on my credit file. Over 90 days ago I wrote this creditor, and your credit bureau as well in question and demanded proof that I am their customer. I asked for proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. So far none of them has been able to provide such proof to me. I have sent follow-up letters to each of them and there is still no proof. I have attempted by phone contact, but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. I have fully investigated my rights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, XXXX v XXXX XXXX Mo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt, in fact exists. I have copies of the letters, several police reports stating that this is a fraudulent account, and dates prepared to bring to court on XXXX XXXX. Also, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, these disputed items may not appear on my credit report if they can not be supported by any evidence. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if they can not verify the debt within 30 days, then it must be removed. Your letters to me claim to have "" VERIFIED '' the debt, but this is in fact not true under law. Simply contacting the alleged creditor and asking them to match up numbers in their database is no sufficient verification for identity theft. Someone has stolen my identity and used my information without my authorization. Now I am suing your credit bureau EQUIFAX for reporting falsified debt on my credit files without proper verification that this fraudulent account belongs to me. I have provided more than sufficient evidence to have these fraudulent accounts REMOVED/BLOCKED off of my credit files. I also had XXXX other fraudulent accounts that where opened last year around the same time this fraudulent account was opened. I have the letters from those creditors whereas they DEEMED all XXXX accounts ( FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTS ) in which they REMOVED/BLOCKED those accounts from reporting on my credit files. Im attaching my latest police report to show that these are fraudulent accounts giving more proof of my fraud claim at this current time. Your fraud department also have prior police reports that show that these accounts are fraudulent accounts as well. I have also filed a identity theft report with the XXXX FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ) with the government regarding these fraudulent accounts on my credit files with your credit bureau ( EQUIFAX XXXX. Im attaching that document as well which shows even more proof of these fraudulent accounts, and your credit bureau reporting false information still. You may contact me before XXXX XXXX XXXX ) via mail before the court date to begin the lawsuit process to rectify this situation at hand. This matter can be settled simply by your agreement to remove the false information from my credit file PERMANENTLY. I require a response in a timely manner regarding your credit bureau deleting this falsified information off of my credit file. If I get another pointless letter from you saying that it has already been "" XXXX '' then there will be no more opportunity for negotiation. This will proceed in court until I have successfully proven to a judge that this false information must be removed from my credit file. I will also be aggressively pursuing the full judgment that I can get against Equifax for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Defamation. I have already won a similar lawsuit against XXXX Credit Bureau. I will agree to a similar settlement with XXXX, if you contact me before XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). If you accept the same terms as XXXX did, then I will dismiss my lawsuit against Equifax and you will NOT need to appear in XXXX XXXX XXXX, GEORGIA ). 
The items to be removed from my credit report are listed as states : XXXX XXXX PERSONAL LOANS & XXXX XXXX XXXX Please take in consideration my concerns regarding this matter and I hope to hear from you in a timely manner.

"In 2009 I graduated with my XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX putting me at around {$42000.00} in student loan debt. I contacted my student loan servicer, Navient then Sallie Mae, via telephone regarding loan repayment plan and loan forgiveness as I qualify based on my employment. I asked specifically what I needed to do to initiate the 10 years of payments to qualify for loan forgiveness. The loan servicer stated that all I needed to do was start making payments and show proof of qualifying employment. The servicer reported that at ten years of active payments I just had to apply for loan forgiveness. I was informed the sliding scale payment option would be acceptable ( payments start out low then slowly increase as time goes by ). At no time did they state I needed to apply for the income driven repayment plan and had to switch my loan to a Direct Loan in order for the payments to qualify. All the while, anytime I changed jobs I submitted qualifying loan forgiveness employment proof to my loan servicer specifically showing my intentions to request loan forgiveness. Seven years later I contacted my loan servicer to submit updated proof of qualifying employment as I changed jobs, all the while actively making payments towards my loan in accordance to what my loan servicer had instructed. At that time I checked with Navient on what the process looked like for when I actually needed to apply for loan forgiveness. That was the first time I received information from my loan servicer that I had no qualifying payments, needed to switch to an income driven repayment plan, and switch my current federal loan to a Federal Direct Loan before I could start making qualifying payments. Seven years of responsible consistent payments were not counted towards loan forgiveness based on the misinformation provided to me by my loan servicer even though the amount I was paying monthly was similar to what loan forgiveness qualifying payments would have looked like. I attempted to reconcile this issue with Navient, as the company was aware of my intentions for loan forgiveness based on my initial request as well as ongoing submissions of proof of qualifying employment for loan forgiveness.

Every time you call, you get XXXX of XXXX messages - 1 ) they are experiencing high call volume and to call back the next business day ( automatically hangs up on you ) or 2 ) they are experiencing technical difficulties and to call back the next business day ( again hangs up on you ). Further, when you submit an online request to cancel your service, you click submit and a XXXX number pops up and tells you to call customer service. Clearly, this company is making it difficult to cancel their service as they are fighting the CFPB and banks denying their ACH services. I submitted an initial complaint months ago regarding UDAP. They market bi-weekly payments, but really it 's bi-weekly debits. They are only making a single mortgage payment for you. Very deceptive, and bad business. Now, they are making it unfair to customers by denying the ability to cancel. I am sick of calling. 

Futhermore, I received the below email which is completly pathetic : Dear Customer, I am writing you this email to speak from my heart and ask you for your help ... For many years NBA has provided services that have helped consumers like you to eliminate interest charges and pay off your mortgages faster. As a result, lenders do not like what we are doing for consumers because it affects their interest revenue. Over the years we have faced many battles instigated by Lenders and currently we are locked in a battle with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) who wants to take away our valuable consumer service from you. 

When I first started NBA I had XXXX secretary helping me to take calls from consumers. After I had just taken my life savings of {$10000.00} to mail out letters to consumers to educate and make them aware of our biweekly program service, I was prompted in my heart from the Lord to go pray and fast for a week at the small church I was attending. I thought to myself that there was no way I could do this because I just spent my life savings to mail out all those letters and I needed to help my secretary take all the calls coming in to enroll the customers in our service. There was no way she could handle all the calls and I could end up losing my life savings. I had my wife and XXXX little girls living in an apartment depending on me to provide for them. How could I just take off a whole week, after I had just mailed out all those letters, to pray and fast for a week at my church? There was no way! But for the next two days I kept feeling it so strongly in my heart that I was supposed to do this. I told my wife what I felt and she said, "" you better do what the Lord is wanting you to do ''. So after debating it in my mind I decided that I needed to do it. So I called my pastor and told him what I wanted to do. He was encouraged by what I was choosing to do and he gave me a key to the church. That Monday, instead of heading to the office to answer all the calls that would have just started to come in, I was on my way to my church to pray and fast. I thought in my mind, as I was driving, that I could lose everything. There was no way my XXXX, just recently hired, secretary was going to be able to handle all those calls successfully and enroll them. But I thought, if I lose everything because I put the Lord first by obeying and seeking him first, so be it! That will be my testimony that I lost everything pursuing the Lord and obeying what he put on my heart to do.

"On approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I was approached by Citibank to add to my charge account of some 33 years the benefit of double cash back on select items only. I honestly do not remember if this was by mail or email, but Citibank customer service advises me that I responded by email. This is odd to me as I thought I had opted out of their emails many months ago, and in fact show my last received email in XX/XX/XXXX and did not receive another email from them until I received my first double cash back statement in XX/XX/XXXX. Perhaps you can verify whether I did indeed opt out. I do however remember initiating the process to add double cash back ( on selected items only ) to my account. I have had several other banks make me this offer and have done so without incident. When I paid this years XXXX statement, I happened to look at my rewards points balance and noticed it was only around XXXX points. Before I made the change to double cash back, my rewards point balance was around XXXX points. Thinking there was an error, I called their Rewards Point Dept., and was informed that the balance of XXXX points shown on my statement was correct. They also confirmed that I did indeed have some XXXX points before the conversion. Evidently, in the fine print that I supposedly agreed to, there was a clause that read "" all previous unused rewards points would expire in 60 days ''. Obviously, I was upset and not satisfied with this answer and asked what recourse I had. I was informed that I could contact Citibank customer service and was given their phone number. 
After speaking with customer service, I was told the same thing that Rewards Service told me. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was transferred to a supervisor by the name of XXXX. He said he was not allowed to give me his last name. He told me the exact same thing that the others had told me. That I did have XXXX points and they expired on XX/XX/XXXX, 60 days after the account change. He further explained that I did do this online and that when I hit the "" I agree '' button, that the point forfeiture information was included in what I agreed to, so that as far as they were concerned, I did indeed agree to it and there was absolutely nothing that could be done about it. I told him that I wanted to file a formal protest and was grudgingly told that I could write to Thank You Rewards, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX SD XXXX, but that it would not do any good. Incidentally, XXXX told me on three different occasions that my protest would be a waste of time and not do any good. So, I am doing this instead! 
As a senior citizen, and somewhat elderly, I feel very taken advantage of and maybe even a little discriminated against. My mind is just not as sharp as it used to be, and the supplied information was confusing to me. I believe that this was intentional on Citibank 's part, and that any normal person of my age would have found it confusing, ambiguous, and misleading. I would be very interested to know if my age group was targeted by CitiBank in what I can only think of as a stealth scam. 
My wife and I are on a semi fixed income and it had taken us decades to collect those points. There is no way that increasing my rewards points on selected items only, would ever come remotely close to the XXXX points ( {$850.00} ) that was taken from us. That is a lot of money to us and it was part of our small nest egg. As the old saying goes, "" I may be ignorant, but I'm not stupid '', and I would never have knowingly agreed to this ridiculous proposition. Amazingly, Citibank allows you to directly convert your points to pay or credit your account. At the very least, they could have just rolled my points over as a payment or credit on my changed account. I truly believe Citibank was being intentionally deceptive and dishonest, or rolling my points over would have been the obvious solution. Also, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a "" Confirmation of Account Change '' letter ( attached ). Nowhere in the letter nor the two accompanying brochures was forfeiture of unused previous points mentioned, nor did I reveive any other notices of impending rewards point forfeiture. In my opinion, this is the absolute personification of intentional omission. 
I can not help but ask myself who was benefited by this account change. It certainly was not in my ( the customers ) best interest but seems to have greatly benefited Citibank. And just to add insult to injury, I just received another letter from Citibank ( attached ) informing me that as of XX/XX/XXXX, they are removing some of the promised benefits attached to this card, ... Roadside Assistance, Car Rental Insurance, Citi Price Rewind ( dropping from maximum of {$2500.00} to {$1000.00} per year ) etc. I am however convinced that their "" fine print '' allowed them to do this and that I agreed to that also. 
Here 's the bottom line, ... I was told that my account number would stay the same, and I didnt even realize that I was doing anything but adding a benefit to my current account. At least that is how it was represented and how I interpreted it. If I had been aware that I was signing up for a totally new and different type of account that could result in the forfeiture of decades of earned rewards points, I certainly would have been more cautious and diligent, and most probably, not even considered it. 
Thank you in advance for you time and consideration regarding this matter and anything you can do to help me resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated. If there are further questions, concerns, or additional information is required, please advise",Credit / Prepaid card

"The following is a copy of the letter of complaint I sent. Several follow-up calls and escalations rendered no solution. They claim they have no evidence of my having applied for the interest-free card offer ( for a term ), and therefore wo n't correct their mistake of sending me a card with interest. 

XXXX XXXX, 2016 To Accounts Supervisor, I am contacting you to rectify a situation. I recently opened a credit card with Capital One, due to the offer of added miles with a purchase of $ XXXX within a time frame, and no-interest payments for over a year. I charged $ XXXX to my new card on XXXX/XXXX/16, and received the first email copied below, dated XXXX. For some reason, the link to "" make a payment '' was n't working, but I made my {$100.00} payment the following month. I had also called to ask for the specific date on which my no-interest period ends, but I was put on hold for a very long period, and no one came back to answer my question. I called back another day to inquire again, and was told that I have no offer for no-interest payments! 

This floored me, and I am very disturbed and distressed about this situation! I specifically signed up for the card, because of the no-interest offer for a period of time, and I knew I 'd need this, because I was intending to use it for the very large purchase that I 'd anticipated. It is unacceptable that my terms are now with interest charged! I was told that perhaps I had accidentally selected the wrong card offer, but I do n't see how I could have done this! I hope that this is just an error on the part of Capital One, and not a bait-and-switch scheme, which is what it feels like. Once again, it is unsatisfactory that I am now being charged interest on my purchase! I never would have gotten this card with interest, knowing that I was about to make a $ XXXX purchase! I am escalating this to you, because I need this situation rectified, to where I have no interest for the term. Thank you for your immediate assistance.

"XXXX XXXX SSN XXXX I took out a loan with RiseCredit on XX/XX/XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX My payments were automatically drafted from my bank account on the XX/XX/XXXX and last day of the month. In XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into an agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX, so they could negotiate lower payments and interest on my debts while I made one monthly payment. XXXX made an offer of {$200.00} per month for my account and on XX/XX/XXXX RiseCredit countered with an offer of XXXX per month for 12 months ( see attachment Rise Credit_Offer_Agreement_XXXX ), and on XX/XX/XXXX RiseCredit returned the accepted written proposal to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( see attachment Rise Credit_Accepted notice_XXXX XXXX ). 
My XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX payments have been made as agreed upon ( see attachments Rise Confirmation of XX/XX/XXXX Payment, Rise Confirmation of XX/XX/XXXX  Payment, and Rise Confirmation of XX/XX/XXXX Payment ).

On XX/XX/XXXX, I found that RiseCredit had begun reporting my payment as more than 30 days past due on my credit ( see attachment Credit Reporting ). This caused my previously rising score to drop significantly ( see attachment Credit Score Impact ). I contacted RiseCredit on  XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) believing there had been a misunderstanding. I spoke with someone in the special handling department, and I was advised that all of my payments are being made as agreed, but they report to the credit bureaus based on my original agreement and due dates from when I took out the loan. 
As a matter of law, a new contract supersedes a prior contract. RiseCredit has no right to report my payments based on a previous agreement that no longer has effect. I have never let my payments come late on this loan, and they should not be reporting them as such. I understand and agree that the account will ultimately be reported as settled, but I do not believe that an account is past due just because a company agreed to accept a different payment plan and dates. I would like this past due payment removed from my credit as it has made a drastic impact.",Other
"My first issue this is my first time buying a vehicle on my own. I do n't think I can ever go through this experience of buying another car. I get nauseous thinking about it.

I had no idea this interest rate was high moreover it was illegal in my state and the state rhe financial company was in. I 'm in Arkansas. They 're in California. I bought the SUV XX/XX/XXXXand some months even was able to pay double payments. My state was hit with a flood of historical proportions that have ever been able to be recorded. I had put my payment in our outbox at our local post office that serves XXXX citizens in our small town the day before the flood. It would have been a week early had it left the next day and it was for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments. {$760.00}. When I woke up the next day water was everywhere. I mean EVERYWHERE. Our local XXXX had 9 ft of standing water. The president and our governor declared us a natural disaster area. Apparently my payment never left the post office. Which the post office was barely standing after the water receded. Fine. I called Westlake and they took a check over the phone and I deferred one payment to the end of my contract. Two weeks later I was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX and had to immediately take a sabbatical from work to start XXXX and XXXX. I called Westlake again and they told me they would defer 90 days of payments to the end of my contract. Paid them a {$50.00} dollar payment for each deferred payment. My doctors said more than likely I 'd be at least able to return to work by then. Westlake called me the entire time I was in the hospital, twice when I was receiving XXXX and asked for their payment. I said we deferred those I paid you {$50.00} per payment. I 'm sick may I please call you back. Most of the time I was immediately hung up on and recieved outlandish attitude from the customer service representative.

I could n't take it any more and I was trying get healthy. When the dealership called to ask for my payoff they were told the vehicle was in repossession status and demanded the address. I was four hours from home. No one gave them the address and I left after waiting 45 minutes seeing if anyone would show up. They knew the dealerships name and city and state. I know they have XXXX. So I waited. No one ever showed so I leave to come home. Drive four hours home. The next day I get up to go back to my first day back at my place of employment and my truck is gone. Immediately I assume they repossessed it. Who would n't. I fumed for about two weeks and I finally answered the phone one morning when they called and I 'm informed they do not have possession of the vehicle and I need to call the local police as the agent is speaking to someone else and I hear someone say "" Do n't tell him we have it .... '' Then I start getting Badgered about late payments. I said no those were deferred and I 'm told we do n't offer a program like that.

"I have previously submitted a report on XXXX XXXX and XXXX, now I would like to submit my complaint with SallieMae. 

I have XXXX SallieMae loans, XXXX being 7.2 % interest equaling {$7300.00} and the other being 3.5 % interest equaling {$6000.00} ( I believe 3.5 % is the lowest on any of my private student loans so only XXXX of them is feasible ). 

The problem with the loan is NOT the amount, rather the fraudulent interest rates I am being charged. Because the interest continues to compound, my payments barely eat into the principal leaving me with a bigger loan than I started. 

I make every payment on time, however it seems to make little difference if I pay more than what is due. This is ruining my credit report because my debt to income ratio looks horrible, even though I make all my payments on time. 

What this is effectively doing is keeping me from getting any sort of loan to buy a house, or put a dime back into the economy. It does appear as though this will be the case for a long while unless something is down to lower my interest rates to an acceptable level. 

Paying $ XXXX- {$1200.00} a month in student loans is not feasible when I am barely cutting into the principal and lowering the loan amount. In every case of my loans, they are now currently bigger than when I first received them even though I am paying this amount of money EACH month. This should not be allowed and is a form of XXXX 

I am not asking for my loans to be forgiven, however I am asking that my interest rates be put at a normal level of almost all other loans in this country at 2 % interest. There is no reason I should be suffering from an fraudulent interest rate ; students should not be punished for seeking a higher education. 

After calling each of these companies several times, I have found NO help in trying to refinance my loans. The only option I get is to go into forbearance, which would mean a lifetime of debt for me and possibly other family members. 

Please review my case and understand where I am coming from. I can not express enough how these interest rates undermine my consumer rights.",Student loan

"I am writing you to request help to remove foreclosure from my credit score on all XXXX along with any negative comments. The reasons are as follows : 1. I was notified that I was included in a Class Action Suit against Wells Fargo Mortgage XXXX XXXX for an illegal mortgage. 
2. Wells Fargo knew I had an illegal mortgage from XXXX. Wells Fargo agreed and signed in Federal Court to modify all the mortgages that were included in the class action suit. 
3. I spent the next year trying to talk to them. I have names, times and dates if needed. 
4. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX who asked "" Why I never applied for a modification? '' I tried numerous times and was turned away repeatedly. I did finally get them to accept the application which apparently was not processed in a timely manner since XXXX XXXX had no record of it. 
5. At this point under the advice of my attorney, I stopped paying my mortgage, in hopes we would have an open honest conversation concerning correcting or modifying my mortgage. I did not write the mortgage agreement. The Bank wrote the mortgage agreement. It was their correction to make, not mine. 
6. I am enclosing a copy of a certified letter that states I am included in the class action suit. I am also enclosing a copy of the court record dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX It states that Wells Fargo was denied the right to foreclose on me. 
7. XXXX XXXX, my husband and I agreed to sell our house. We gave up, the stress was unbearable. 
8. On XXXX of XXXX, we closed on the sale of our home with a profit, not in foreclosure or in a short sale. Wells Fargo was paid in full. 
Wells Fargo 's lawyers and my lawyers were in contact with each other the whole time. 
They have ruined my credit. We were unable to buy or rent adequate and appropriate housing after selling our home. Five years Wells Fargo played games with apparently no intention of honoring their signed agreement in Federal Court to modify and correct the illegal mortgages. 
After 40 years making timely payments to mortgage banks, this has ruined my credit and reputation. I feel they have slandered my name and implied that I am not reliable. This has caused unbelievable financial damage and hardship to our family.

The representatives put me on hold and came back on the phone and said, the manager will not be able to give me any information about my loan so I do n't need to wait because I just have to wait for my welcome packed in the mail. Now these are my questions, how come the Seterus could n't give me any information about my account when I was told by XXXX that all my questions or concerns would be answered by Seterus since my loan was transferred over. How come the Rep was so rude and could n't get me a manager on the phone and tell me anything about my account, how much I owed, when was my next payment. This sounds very fishy and I do n't want my loan account with Seterus. 
The reason why this is important is because I am in the midst of selling my apt and have a potential selling date by XXXX XXXX and have an additional fee that I owe for the sell of the apt that will be paid at the time of the closing and I do n't want to see surprising fees from Seterus. I need to know what my payments are now so that there are no surprises at the time of the closing. As a consumer, if my loan is transferred to Seterus, Seterus should have all the information ready for me when I called and not give me the run around and then say a manager is not available and that they can not access my loan information. Right now this is frustrating as I need this information. What are my rights as a consumer in regards to getting this information without having to wait for a welcome packets from Seterus. My other question is, "" why is did XXXX Bank transfer my loan to a new company and I have no say about the transfer. Why did XXXX Bank wait less than 2 weeks to inform me about this transfer. '' My account number with Seterus is XXXX and their phone number is XXXX. My loan number with XXXX Bank was XXXX.",Mortgage

"The Credit Bureau I am continually having issues with is EQUIFAX. 
I was a victim of identity theft, and have worked on correcting all the fraudulent information with all XXXX bureas for five years. It has taught me to check what the bureaus are listing more than just once, annually. 
So, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX I was in a XXXX, which my terrible attorneys told me I should persue at a trial. Before I sought out legal advice I had told the hospital to please file my emergency room visit, and all my medical, with my medical insurance company. 
Several years later I was notified that MY ATTORNEY HAD ABANDONED MY CASE, and I would receive NOTHING to compensate all I had lost, all when the person at fault was heavily insured. 
These court proceedings finally ended in XXXX of XXXX, yet one week later I received a notice from XXXX Hospital that my account had not been paid, and therefore it would be placed in collections if I was not going to satisfy the entire balance. 
I phoned the billing administrator immediately, and not only did I ask "" HOW '' that could be the case, since I had requested them bill MY MEDICAL INSURANCE IN FULL, but also that I had not ( until receiving that XXXX letter ) been guilty of ignoring a bill I had no knowledge existed, & that the case had just ended days before, much less 90-days late, putting it in default status, therefore collection worthy. 
The administrator told me, right away, that she would take care of this, because my records showed that I had signed all the hospital 's paperwork, & complied by giving the hospital all my insurance information at the time of my ER visit, and I should never have received a bill. 
I thanked her, profusely ; but was unaware that this {$0.00} ZEROED-OUT bill would show ANYWHERE within the XXXX credit bureaus. It is only listed with Equifax , and disputing this has proven futile, due to Equifax 's practices of failing the consumers by NOT listing any phone number where one might be able to explain what 's going on, and be advised about how they can go about having these types of things removed! 
Equifax is infamous for directing any & everyone to a website for all disputes. Well, what can one do if they are "" willing '' to file the online dispute, but are told ( after entering all their sensitive data ) that "" They can not do so because the information listed DOES NOT MATCH the information which Equifax has on file ''?? 
Throughout my fight to fix my credit, due to people who assumed my identity, I ended up having to file XXXX reports with the XXXX, and have stayed on top of the continual issues that still arise due to the felonious actions of others who will never be held accountable, although the endless proof I have against each XXXX. Should n't this be enough? 
Obviously, if you were to ask Equifax , their answer will be to "" TAKE IT TO WWW.EQUIFAX.COMXXXX ''. 
It 's a shame when the XXXX credit bureau used by such a majority of the world 's businesses ... the XXXX most consumers feel they can trust to list only what is correct, due to the decades of time in which they have been monitoring the credit of all potential consumers feel as if they SHOULD NOT be held accountable for their crippling mistakes. They are a fine example of a business proving to everyone else their unbalanced sense of grandiosity, and have even gone to such lengths where they are allowed to begrudge human beings the opportunity/rights to even do what all other bureaus gladly "" will '' do.

"I am set up to pay a set amount for my loans every month to Nelnet, my loan servicer. This amount is autodebited. A few months ago, I decided to pay an extra {$1400.00} at my loan on top of my usual monthly amount. On Nelnet 's website, I specifically chose to direct the full amount of this extra payment to Loan XXXX, which has the highest interest rate. I also specifically chose the option to NOT have this extra payment postpone my regular monthly due date for the loan. 

However, Nelnet ignored everything. While they put the {$1400.00} toward Loan XXXX, they stopped paying off Loan XXXX for the following months. Meaning that my scheduled monthly payments now only went to Loans XXXX and XXXX This made me accrue {$300.00} in extra interest to Loan XXXX AND ultimately it did not allow me to lower the principle on that loan as I had stated/intended when I paid the extra amount. 

The Nelnet customer service rep I spoke with said that Nelnet wanted to realign all of my monthly payment due dates given my extra payment. However, as I had already told Nelnet, all of that extra money should be given on TOP of the monthly payments, so it should not have changed anything with my due dates. This is a sketchy and dishonest strategy by NelNet to make sure that all loans end at the same time ( which is exactly what I was trying to avoid .... I wanted to pay off my loans in less than 10 years! ) so that they maximize the amount of interest they collect. 

I totally understand that the loan servicer needs to make money to stay in business, but they should not be allowed to ignore direct customer requests/specifications about payments in doing so. This dishonest business practice should not be tolerated by the CFPB.",Student loan

XXXX sent me an email apologizing for XXXX mistake and said she was highly convinced that i would get approved with XXXX XXXX XXXX and thats why she told me i was banking with them. He also said it would be at the same rate and monthly payment. I responded to him that its unacceptable to have a person in the finance department giving confirmations to buyers off of being highly convinced. I also explained to him i had no intention on financing with them since i had already been pre approved with my own personal bank at chase but since they insisted i run my credit with them that is what i did. I also told him i wanted to get switched back to chase bank. Overall i was upset at how they handled the situation and their customer service. 

XXXX called me a few days after i sent him my email and told me it would be too late for them to switch over financial institutions and that i would have to apply for a refinancing with my bank and that was my only option. He also said he had a friend that works for XXXX that he would see if they could help me out. 

I havent heard back from him, but i did call chase and apply for refinancing in which they said that i was declined since it would not be through the dealership and they were not willing to take on full liability.

My lender is stating that my home has been foreclosed on but they are in the process of buying it back and they are also stating that it is in the process of being foreclosed on again. They will not discuss any modification options with me.,Mortgage
"My situation began with XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXXwhen I began a loan modification just before I left the country to work in the XXXX XXXX. Over the next three years XXXX XXXX XXXX kept delaying the process by constantly requesting more and more paperwork, different forms, saying the program had changed so they needed all new paper work. While at their instructions I did not make any payments until they gave me a modification offer. This process drug out for about 3 years until in XX/XX/XXXX when I was given an offer that I considered ludicrous. It was NO modification at all. So at that time opted for a short sale. By XX/XX/XXXX I had an agent who had a buyer for the short sale. XXXX XXXX XXXX  had paid my step son about {$2500.00} cash for keys because he was living in the house while I was overseas. I thought it was a done deal. I learned several months later that XXXX XXXX XXXX had cancelled the sale in XX/XX/XXXXthen foreclosed and sold the property at auction in the dark of night without any notification to myself or my agent. I later learned that it was sold to XXXX XXXX for {$110000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX   is a partner/cousin of XXXX XXXX XXXX. Sounds like a pretty shady deal to me. I spoke to the foreclosure attorneys who are listed on the court document and they assured me that the foreclosure was completed. The foreclosure was done as a service to XXXX XXXX another XXXX XXXX XXXX   company who I understand has been under investigation. So again I thought the property was gone and since I was working overseas there was nothing I could do about it and just let it go.

I returned home to the US at the end of XX/XX/XXXXand was looking for a new place to live. Upon checking my credit I learned that the loan had not been removed at the time of the foreclosure but remained as a big negative mark on my credit file. I also found my house pictured on a real-estate site with the caption not for sale. Why was it shown on a real-estate site but not for sale? I contacted the agent listed and was told that they were given the listing by XXXX XXXX XXXX but the bank kept refusing all offers for the property. More research I came to find out that a company called SPS was now handling the loan. Come to find out that in XX/XX/XXXX at the same time XXXX XXXX XXXX was having XXXX XXXX  foreclose on the property they had also transferred servicing of the loan to SPS as a delinquent loan NOT a foreclosed loan. SPS knew NOTHING about the foreclosure. When XXXX XXXX XXXX foreclosed on the property they simply abandon it, washed their hands of the property turned it over the SPS, had NO oversite, and allowed damage and vandalism to occur. When I contacted SPS, I was asked if I wanted to begin a loan modification. They apparently had NO record that XXXX XXXX XXXX had put me through the process 5 years earlier. They were also unaware that I was not living in the house and had been overseas until XX/XX/XXXX. They told me that the property was indeed mine and I could be living in it. So after consulting a couple of law firms and the MS attorney general we moved back in in XX/XX/XXXX, and began again the modification process with SPS. Over the next couple of years I learned what a serious mess this has become. For the first couple years SPS refused to accept that the property had been foreclosed on and that issue needs to be corrected at the county level. The damage that the bank allowed needs to be repaired as well as my credit that has been ruined by the banks actions needs to be corrected.

They have me in a position of not being able to not having the ability to live safely and securely in my home and not being able to buy another home. This is the main saga of the hell that I have been subjected to over the past few years. There are more details that I will fill you in on. The primary companies involved are ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Select Portfolio Servicing After going back of forth for 4 years with the bank, SPS, XXXX XXXX, I was told last year that they were going to resend the foreclosure because it was done illegally in XX/XX/XXXX, and the property would be put back in my name. They wanted me to sign off on the plan, whatever that means. Then in XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted again via my attorney, and told that the original foreclosure was now legal. Now they are offering me cash for keys again and want to evict me. The story is more complex than I was able to explain here. About 2 year ago they offered me a deal for a set price /rate. I was unable to accept at the time because of the ownership issue still being up in the air.",Mortgage

"On XX/XX/XXXX I received communication via cell phone from IQ Data Collection Agency. I must admit the phone call was a surprise as I had attempted multiple times to get in touch with XXXX ( the leasing company that sent me to collections ) and never heard back from them. I verbalized this to XXXX, the debt collector who was assigned to my case. She then proceeded to tell me that she worked for XXXX and even made references to my lease agreement. Based on that lie, I continued with the conversation. I have very little experience in dealing with debt collection agencies. So, I was going into this with very little knowledge of my rights or what XXXX 's rights were as the debt collector. I have since educated myself and believe that XXXX violated several laws ( of which I will list at the end of this communication ). I also want it to be known that I am very seriously looking into taking legal action. I took responsibility for my debt and made it clear that I was more than willing to work with XXXX to find a resolution. Despite my willingness to be cooperative XXXX was rude and unhelpful right from the beginning. XXXX told me that I could not dispute the debt without my credit being negatively affected. She also told me that I could not make payments over time on my debt without my credit being negatively affected. I believe I was also told legal action could be taken against me which caused me further confusion and anxiety. Again, at this time I did not know what was possible and what was n't possible so this threat absolutely terrified me. Throughout our entire conversation she was a bully, dishonest, emotionally abusive, unhelpful, and took advantage of the fact that I did n't know what I was doing. I was bullied, yelled at, and berated until I was so upset I could n't even think clearly. I told her the way she was speaking to me was upsetting me, making my thoughts unclear, and that I was afraid. Her emotional abuse made me unable to have an effective and productive conversation. This was only fuel for her fire, and she made it well aware, that she was aware, of my state of mind, and continued with her bullying. I wanted to get the debt I owed taken care of and figured out, but not with her due to the way she was treating me. I asked to speak to someone else or a supervisor and she told me this was n't an option. This entire situation was incredibly traumatic. I am not used to dealing with humans who treat other humans as she did. I believe this to be a bad business practice no matter the type of business. I made a substantial payment towards my debt, but As of right now, I am still unclear what my options are or where my debt lies ; I am too traumatized and afraid to contact IQ Data directly after my horrible experience with them. 
As I mentioned I will be looking into taking legal action and once I do so I will have an even more clear understanding of which laws were in fact violated. 
Here are some the laws I believe IQ Data violated : 1. Unfair Acts or Practices The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits conduct that constitutes an unfair act or practice. An act or practice is unfair when : ( 1 ) It causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers ; ( 2 ) The injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers ; and ( 3 ) The injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. 

A "" substantial injury '' typically takes the form of monetary harm, such as fees or costs paid by consumers because of the unfair act or practice. However, the injury does not have to be monetary. Although emotional impact and other subjective types of harm will not ordinarily amount to substantial injury, in certain circumstances emotional impacts may amount to or contribute to substantial injury. In addition, actual injury is not required ; a significant risk of concrete harm is sufficient.",Debt collection

It 's too much fraud in this world for them to think that this is an acceptable form of proof. THIS PROVES NOTHING. At this point, I believe United Revenue Corp, is intentional trying to deceive me. They are trying to get me to pay an unverified debt they have no proof that it is mine. Under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of the debt they say I owe. So, I am requesting proof that I am indeed the party they are asking to pay this debt, the date of the alleged medical service, and proof that there is some contractual obligation which is binding on me to pay this debt. Since I could n't get the proper documentation from them via certified mail and they have violated the FDCPA by reporting a unvalidated debt to the credit reporting agencies, I am requesting again that this account is deleted from my credit reports or ple ase provide me with the proper documentation, so this debt can be resolved. Please attach copies of : Any agreement with your client that grants you the authority to collect on this alleged debt, or proof of acquisition of purchase or assignment, and authorization under subtitle D of t he ARRA, SEC. 13401.

"XXXX, Chase Loan number XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX, as a new home owner, I accepted a variable rate loan with limited knowledge of how that loan would work. I accept my decision to do so and my responsibility for that commitment. In XX/XX/XXXX, a job opportunity took my wife and I out of state. At that point our condo had negative equity of approximately {$150000.00}. We made the responsible decision to retain our property, rent it and continue to pay on the loan to which I 'd committed. From XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX our mortgage spiked 85 % from {$1400.00} per month to {$2600.00} an increase of {$1200.00}. 
I am an US veteran who has never been late or short on my mortgage yet I am currently facing the loss of my home. I believe the structure of the loan, originated in XX/XX/XXXX, is the reason this agency was created, and I 'm seeking your perspective on my suspicion that I 've been deceived, treated unfair and the target of predatory practices.

Per the script presented to me prior to each discussion, these calls are all recorded or monitored and therefore should be available for confirmation of accuracy. I can provide a copy my recap of each interaction as well as my phone bills to aid identification and review of each call if necessary.

Numerous occasions where there was no adherence to the communicated timeline. 
An unwarranted move of my loan from modification to liquidation status resulting in an 18-day delay. 
An occasion where I was told that I was calling too much, and that I should, "" ... just let the process happen. '' Two occasions where I was told that action had been taken, that had not. 
As we are now approaching 90 days into a 30-day process, I employ your help and am seeking your intercession to aid us in coming to a rapid resolution to this situation. I 'm specifically requesting a copy and interpretation of what the 10-year adjustment entails, and assistance acquiring a streamline of our loan to allow us to keep the home. I would like a response to this request, and guidance as to how best to proceed from this point. 
It is as result of this treatment, that I have lost faith in the sincerity of Chase to want to aid resolution of the situation and question if their true intent all along has been to force me to default on my loan justifying their desire to repossess my home. To a juggernaut of a company such as Chase this event means nothing, but to my family and I it has a great deal of impact ; damaging my credit, eliminating a path to grow future financial stability through this home, and hurting our ability to borrow for years to come. I 've confirmed to Chase verbally and through my actions that I 'd like to retain our home, have never been late or short on a payment in over 10 years and feel I 'm being strung along towards a decision that may not have positive intent or be in consideration of my best interest.

"The process of refinancing with Santander bank took XXXX months to complete! We used XXXX as our broker and between the XXXX companies, the process or gathering personal financial information was not only redundant and repetitious ... it was excessively grueling! Due to the bank 's lack of proper document management, we were forced to comply with an egregious amount of requests for personal financial documents, sometimes many times requesting duplicates already faxed weeks prior. The obvious lack urgency in completion of the underwriting process, coupled with the bank 's blatant disregard for an appraisal appeal, forced us to forfeit our low XXXX year refi interest rate and doubled our monthly payments through their mandated, private mortgage insurance. The reason for the PMI issuance stemmed from the insultingly low home appraisal conducted by an incompetent, "" independent '' appraiser chosen directly by the bank. The appraisal was riddled with careless errors and the valuation of our home was at least {$100000.00} below expected. We reacted with an appeal we offered our detailed rebuttal along with new ( more appropriate ) comps while point out the many error corrections issued in the original report. In response to this appeal, the same, biased appraiser was asked to review our written appeal and, predictably, he offered no adjustments to the appraised dollar amount. We submitted another appeal to appeal this review, stating the apparent prejudice of their review process we failed to get a response back from them and had to accept the low appraisal which, then negatively affected our income/debt ratio. The bank continued to drag out this refinancing process by requesting personal financial, tax and bank documents for the remaining months, which forced us out of our once in a lifetime low XXXX year fixed rate! We think they purposely stalled and their practices proved to be a devious and deceptive attempt to drive up our monthly payments, push us into a higher fixed interest rate which assured them a more profitable refinancing loan contract and ultimately boosting their profit margin. We ultimately rescinded the loan the day after we signed at the closing. With our rescission paperwork we requested in a letter that all our money be refunded and asked for an acknowledgment of their incompetence by pointing out these many injustices. By law, the bank needs to respond to our rescission within XXXX days and they missed this deadline. When we finally got a mailed letter from them, instead of an apology, Santander issued a spiteful retort absolving themselves of all wrong-doings while "" graciously '' offering a refund of all funds paid in by us thus far ( which legally needed to be issued to us anyway ). This unfavorable reaction to our complaints only validated our perspectives of their deceit and malicious conduct all the more. As a result, we wasted over XXXX months researching tax information and providing countless documents and emails for nothing ... all we were trying to do is pay our home off quicker with a lower interest rate ... that 's it ... we were n't borrowing more money ... we have a FICO score of XXXX ... .we were never late on a payment with our existing loan or any other credit debt ... we were perfectly good customers who wanted to refinance. That 's it. this process did n't have to be so exhausting ... it was n't like that last time we refinanced!
